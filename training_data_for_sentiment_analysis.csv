174,1,and until that time the porosity continues until it is time to smash it yourself into the log of your head and fall dead.

174,9,Put a few words.
174,10,"Then the essay"" Fourth wedding customs ""was asked, and all the students were asked to ask their home and describe in detail who heard the Mother of God."

175,3,To take away A.
175,4,"A. Sokolov, begin to read my essay onwards and criticize them, but they have already disregarded all the customs that I have described, which I have not heard of any other species."
175,5,"All the same, many were posed for this composition of the troika."

384,10,"One is cut from the skin by 10 rubles, and the other by a quarter less, the third by twenty or thirty rings more, and so on."
384,11,"But from the cutter, the product is branded with colorful letters and delivered to the sorter."
384,12,"Sorters to disassemble, strictly conditional goods, i.e."
384,13,according to the description of the quartermaster's treasury sample.
384,14,"This is the first grade, for private sale the 2nd grade, and, finally, marriage [3rd grade."
385,0,Each grade has a corresponding price.
385,1,"Low grades - 2nd and 3rd grades, the cheapest, are spelled, i.e."
385,2,it turns out which cutter got more marriage.
385,3,"Every cutter has a deduced amount, originally obtained, of the amount you cut, with a discount on marriage."
385,4,"For example, at the cutter, the letter I calculated before sorting: cutting was given 10p.25k."
385,5,"32 kopecks are thrown off by marriage, 9 rubles.93 kopecks are deposited."
385,6,and so on.
385,7,"All these information are transferred to the office, there are written BE books, according to the raw materials, i.e."
385,8,"from whom the raw materials were bought, for example, 3000 leather, every day, when his party is cut up, his account is written and the result of cutting and writing is written, and when all his pairs have ended, the total result is summed up and the total sum of the value of the saved goods and a complex lot of ten parts is displayed, for example, 103 1/4 and gave a pattern for each BE skin, for example, 9 p. 85 K., and this purchase is vari with delivery to the backwaters and the cost of a trip for the purchase of about 7 p .25 k., In books, it is concluded that, in general, such and such a party gave 2 p.6 each 0 to.Every day, the office, writing down a book to open 110 parts and for individual cutters, makes a copy, a common house / called reporters / and this is served daily to the owner of the purchaser, and if there are two or three owners, then to everyone each copy if they want to /."
385,9,"Every day, the owners can observe how profitable or not profitable their purchase is, or one or the other party is profitable or unprofitable, so that the next time you are more careful about the appraisal when purchasing a local area of ​​raw materials."
385,10,So ge daily owners have the opportunity to follow 10 reporters - to control which cutter is more profitable to cut and
386,0,less marriage.
386,1,"If which often changes, i.e."
386,2,"they cut more expensive all year, and tomorrow it’s cheaper than others ”, and then again more expensive, and then two days later it’s cheaper, it’s considered normal, because although the same amount is chosen all the same, there are flaws on the skin: cuts on the face or deep cuts on the back we / i.e."

386,8,"A short E front is not allowed, shakiness of the current is thoroughly ironed."
386,9,"The sorter strictly follows and all that was mistakenly or necessary, closed during opening, the sorter is discarded in the 2nd or 3rd sort."
386,10,"If during a week or two the one who closes regularly gets less and less marriage than the others, then the senior owner, or the father, who is currently at home at the factory, is kindly alone to tell this cutter: ""llo finish work, evening , hall di to many. """
386,11,"Out of the cut, the time ended at 5 pm."
386,12,"All cutters from E nearby villages go home, and the invitee is behind."
386,13,"The others see and guess, with a smile, I ask: ""What, he was wrongly awarded to the owner for tea an invitation to receive."""
386,14,"Indeed, this came at a time when the owners drank tea and came close by a box and planted tea to drink."
386,15,"If the table has only its own village, for help the owner kindly show reporters for tea, regularly {-2 weeks showing the sad results of its cutting."
386,16,You
387,0,"In this case, the cutter cannot say that he was hit every day with pile, or lodministic, or cropped skin, and the other was only clean."
387,1,For no one is given the choice.
387,2,"It is possible to happen two days in a row that the same cutter would fall on the line more quickly, and I-2 would not be able to get all the skin areas in a row, this would not happen in any plant."
387,3,"By virtue of necessity, the protectors are acknowledged."
387,4,"If he’s an old man, then say that it’s time for the glasses to come in or resign, and if he’s young, then the owner should offer him to swap places with other cutters, to stand between 2 more outstanding in cutting and farthing, in doubtful cases, consult with them."
387,5,"However, when it came to our factory, it increased to 500 leathers daily, there were 15 to 20 cutters with the students, then the senior cutters A.V."
387,6,"Pestov was not cut, but the production was specially cut, and then the cutters were badly cut 11 results have already been transmitted through it."
387,7,"Almost daily, or at least 2-3 times a week, A.V.llestov came."
387,8,"The owners had to examine the portals and advised him to tighten up or pay serious attention to one or the other, or completely set aside, especially the unsuccessfully chosen student's cutters."
387,9,"But of course, not every time a plant was called for closure, and sometimes it was discussed with him and other routines for the cutting section of the plant.When he had to pull up the specified cutter, they would tell him: “Because of you, something often takes you to call me tea; I warn you: if you don’t pull up, you won’t be attentive, so the next time I don’t"

388,2,"It was considered unacceptable to embarrass or compromise, to embitter his closure of the circus to outsiders."
388,3,"Every breeder preferred to keep a close-up of his training and believed that his cutters were better than all other plants.When finding out the results of the profitability of goods by pairs, the owners checked their knowledge on the purchase of raw materials."
388,4,This year we were bought in Tyumen!
388,5,"the homogeneous goods of the Russian carnage and almost the entire Barnaul region, except for the part of Rechapov’s party, and almost all of them gave the same results: it was better that the part purchased from Blousov yielded almost one ruble more than others, because ."
388,6,"Blousov is not a commodity dealer, but the richest leather breeder in Yekaterinburg."
388,7,"His clerk bought the raw materials for the Yekaterinburg sogo Bologo plant in Yekaterinburg throughout the winter, he took his time and carefully stored it during drying, and dried it well, not trying to leave extra weight on a pound."
388,8,"You brought Tyumen this party, as said above, late, the customers almost all the time Ehaha, and therefore accidentally had to buy it from Boulousov at the lowest fair price, and when the goods were delivered, the clerk was in a hurry to cut it off: when weighing in bales, it took 2-3 times pounds 3-4, and a little thicker in the roar, then 5 pounds."

389,4,"Selling at the lowest price, they still benefited from this raw material and we remained friends for a long time, although they never sold raw materials anymore, but when I was in Yekaterinburg I always brought home guests to them."

402,3,"They all began to invite to Petro - Pavlovsky, they said that you only need to bring Tyumen to those who buy Pavlodar and Tomsk, or to the Ob - Semipala Tinsk, Barnaul, Biy sk and villages Kamn and Novonikolaevsk."
402,4,"And at Illet Rovavlovsk almost local goods are collected at the same time, Petropavlovsk and from Akmolinsk."
402,5,"These are sold to local breeders, or given for bargaining, and then sent out as a cook, to bring the same merchants back to Akmolinsky and to sell or to raise the Kyrgyz meat again for raw materials, or sheepskin, or lard."

402,7,"and the other breeders waved away their hands, saying: “Where will we go again?"

402,9,"there may be hundreds of sellers and as many buyers: who ""what to see • like - then buy."""
402,10,Sellers argue that to bring to the fair - it is necessary to pay for transportation and other overhead costs that go from 30 to 50 kopecks.
402,11,"at stake, and on the spot, I’m not the half of that expense, i.e."
402,12,"Quarterly, in koyau, I also gave up selling houses, which are at home, so that you will be able to come home to us next time."
402,13,"Breeders object to this by sellers: “You say so when you call yourself, and you come to you, you say differently, you say,“ Well, home, you really need to signify, and it’s more expensive to break the price for fifty dollars"
403,0,"Finally, you’ll say: you have to pay, I have my own barn, at least spend a year, don’t pay for storage, but you bring it to the fair, so you want to sell to everyone at the end of the fair, to rent a room and leave until the next yes."
403,1,Involuntarily you sell that value which was realized in this fair.
403,2,Most breeders.
403,3,it was so argued.
403,4,"Alexey Ilyich Vakhrushev said that if the next year Yekaterinburg connects the Burgas railway line with a railway branch from the Siberian railway, then perhaps it would be possible to get to Petropavlovsk in front of the Tyumen Fair, or take a look at the end of the Tyumen Fair, and Little."

403,14,"I went into a general conversation about what was done along the Great Siberian route and by connecting it to the Urals by the railroad to Yekaterinburg, perhaps the raw materials were, if not all, then most of it to go to Petropavlovsk."
403,15,"In any case, the Petropavlovsk merchants will not bring their goods to Tyumen."
403,16,K.I.
403,17,"Nazarovѣ said that whoever drove Tyumen, all of it was Tyumen and sent along the rivers, as well, it’s more profitable for the Petropavlovtsy from Pavlodar to sail in waterѣ"

404,1,"If the Irbit Fair, the axis of the railways are lost, it will lose its value for the raw materials of leather: H11 Tyumentsi and Petropavlovsk will not take them there, but they will call the factory breeders for themselves."
404,2,"Yes, you see Petropavlovsk, except Birushchev, and the Boer Nashyev brothers, perhaps there are some merchants, the rest are all braided people, keep an eye on them."

404,8,This is completely wrong.
404,9,"Recognize and make sure that there are very respectable and respectable merchants, Petropavlovsk residents; perhaps you admit that they are much better than the Biryunev and Burnashevs you praise now."
404,10,"""All this turned into a joke and the talk stopped."
404,11,"I carefully listened to everything and asked some questions to Biryushev, alone in half a voice: approximately, how much Petropavlovsk is going to collect raw materials, are there large batches?"
404,12,"What complicated whole sort is sorted into lots for sale by the first grade, and in which period of the year is it most convenient to cut, that is, when all raw materials are grouped."

405,3,"Nazarov, saying that Vakhrushev’s young man, Pyotr Al., Apparently became interested in Petropavlovsk and inquired in detail about the Peter and Paul’s raw materials, apparently suggesting trying to go buy Petro Pavlovsk."

411,3,"from my telegram the day arrived, and that we had an evening on the newly-opened railway station, on the eve of which we reached Zuevka, spent the night with our brother and met us."
411,4,"We had a ride in a common open wagon of the 3rd class, vglstѣ with Vasily Par."

411,7,"They went home to the village of Vakhrushevo.Finishing in the nomination about the Tyumen raw materials fairs, I consider it appropriate to say how difficult it was for me to study the theory of determining the cost of coca raw materials, in particular dry coke, i.e."
411,8,"dried for storage.No science or theory: e 19 it turned out, no decree - nіy to this account."
411,9,"Only from practice for leather breeders, it was believed that from one pound of fresh weight - skin, 16 pounds of dry weight of the skin and 12 1/2 pounds were obtained."
411,10,up to 13 1/2 lbs.
411,11,made leather.
411,12,"The Siberian raw materials of the Russian boquette-cutter generally had a total part of 17 to 19 pounds, and that of the Kirghiz cut - from 18 to 19 1/2 p. The Russian skin-cutting was different in that when the throat was cut, the throat cuts a little over the cow, and the lull along the throat peels off only to the lips, the whole pitched skin remains with the skin when you see three broad patches, this is called cheekbones or bangs among breeders."
411,13,"When the cheekbone of the cabbage soup is rocky, sometimes when the skin is opened, one of the knuckles of the leg is removed from the cheekbones and this results in 20-30 kopecks."
411,14,on the skin excess pattern in s
412,0,Kyrgyz cut.
412,1,"In the Russian cut, when the skin is removed, the legs peel off only to the knees, i.e."
412,2,"the skin is obtained with short paws, and therefore the dry raw material, due to the shortened distance, is 1/2 pound lighter against."
412,3,Kyrgyz of the same size on the length of the skin.Kyrgyz cutting is quickly separated by the first appearance.
412,4,"For the Yergiz and Fataras to grumble: cut off the whole head when cutting, releasing more crozi, but nevertheless the whole head is peeled off, even the lips, and left with bruises, but the cheekbones or bangs with skin hang on a thin, patch of skin with a loose skin palm of width i.e."
412,5,"2 or 2 1/2 apex, so that when opening the exposed skin with the end of the leg, you can’t remove the cheekbones of the Kyrgyz skin and the whole bangs of the cheekbones come when you open the flap, which is sold for a whole B."
412,6,3-4 times cheaper through the merchants buy up a piece of sweatshirts to fix shoes and heels.
412,7,"when shooting the Kyrgyz paws, when taking the skin, the paws peel off to the very hoof, long paws are obtained, which is heavier than the raw material, and as the paw or the skin of your legs, when opened, cannot be used for cutting the shafts, because it is already lower, already then again she enters the flap."
412,8,"All this is taken together, and gives the above results, i.e."
412,9,"a horse of the Kyrgyz cut was issued of the same length and width, to give a cut 20-30 k. less than the Russian cut."
412,10,"In addition, some Kyrgyz and Tatars, before drying, raw salted goods are slightly."
412,11,"If you pour heavily salt over the paired skin and put it in a pile for 2-3 days, almost all the salt enters the skin, and the blood and natural moisture of the skin are removed."
412,12,"After 3 days, the skin loosens to dry on a pole in the sun and hang a little"
413,0,"days, then a dry koi for drying gets it with a white salty bakhtarkha and such skin when selling raw materials costs 2/2 - 2 rubles a pound cheaper, because it has salt from 1 to 2 pounds in kakdo skin.Some Kyrgyz manage to salt the tuzlukom, i.e."
413,1,"You pour large chunks of salt, fill it with water."
413,2,"When saltit will bloom, put the skin for a day at a salty time, salt or ace onion."
413,3,"Skin absorb a little salt; the next day, hang it also on poles in the sun."
413,4,"After drying the tightly skinned skin, the bakhtarm almost does not change, dark cinnamon remains nevo, but sometimes the white spots in the salt appear on the groin."
413,5,"In order to disguise this, experienced traders had turpentine stains smeared with turpentine."
413,6,"Or keroseneӣ, and sometimes the whole colka is a little bit about Turpentine turpentine, and brushing wool with a brush will sprinkle it with turpentine or kerosene emg."
413,7,2 All this increases the entire skin from 1/4 F. to 3/4 F. - Bİ average half a pound.
413,8,"Not only the second buyer almost didn’t die, but when he heard the smell, ask the seller what the ace of turpentine and turpentine were for."
413,9,"Seller explain that 313 c. protection from moths, only blue wool is sprayed."
413,10,Forcing evidence to smell with nerst; real one But smelling on both sides.

417,0,My family life and personal affairs.I turn to the memoirs about home devices and family life.After the death of the grandfather Fedor Tim.
417,1,"As I wrote above, I am a father."
417,2,and mother and her family settled down to live in the old.
417,3,"the house is below, and grandmother Olga Pavlovna with her sons Stepan and the rest is in the same house above."
417,4,"So, our life continued in the old house for five years."
417,5,"During this time we, i.e."
417,6,"Alexander and Pavel Fed., Began to build a new house at the corner."
417,7,"the streets and tracts of the street, on the spot where the pride was, Timofe An Fimovich, there were brick sheds and stone barn for bread for the ears, In the first year of construction of our house the construction of the church in our country was finished, the prices for building materials were raised, bought without rushing, because per house, according to the calculation of the architect and the masons, it will take from 100 to 120 thousand bricks, no more."
417,8,Values ​​then existed at 10 pounds.
417,9,burnt brick up to 10 rubles.
417,10,for a thousand.

417,13,"15 rubles each thousand, / i.e."
417,14,"for a ruble for 1,000 rubles / it was only necessary to make sure that the brick was well burned, rang the bell, and most importantly, that there was absolutely no burned brick, the burial ground was called the Ukirip Searcher Monk."
417,15,It was easy to distinguish him in appearance even to an inexperienced consumer.
417,16,"When buying, it was stipulated that every morning, it would be better to develop when to bring a batch of 5-10 wagons."
417,17,"Cyril icha, the carriages would not stack bricks of carts, but would come for the owner."
417,18,In the course of 2-3 months we are.
417,19,"every morning at 5 or 6 o’clock, got up, put on a large boots"
418,0,"and alternately either I, or Apollinariya Alekseevna, went out onto the path and stood for 1-2 hours, watching how the bricks were laid out."
418,1,"If black came across by chance, their garbage would fall into the snow, or the carriage would be taken back."
418,2,"In winter we also prepared quarry stone for the foundation, lime and wood - logs and wood for construction during construction."
418,3,"In the spring, the masons of Nizhny Novgorod contractor Tyurin began to lay brickwork, 4.50 thousand in each."
418,4,"They lodged with the Rusanovs, the house of Kozma Ivanovich Rusanov."
418,5,"Every day we went with our wife and father to the building and climbed the forest to the top, making sure that we put better burnt brick on the front side, and lose weight inside, and, most importantly, to pour more lime."
418,6,The plan was drawn by an architect.
418,7,"The Druzhinins and they themselves approved in the Provincial Construction Division; Druzhinin took only one hundred rubles for the plan.When we began to prepare more for the construction of the house, Ilya Timofeevich was still very friendly and suggested: “Let me draw you plans without any architect and don’t.” I told him: ""Yes, uncle, we have already made a plan for Druzhinin and approved whether you want to look."""
418,8,"They looked and said for a long time: ""It is good, but the windows are large and the rooms are high, it will be bad to twitch warmly, a lot of wood will go for fuel."""
418,9,But that’s over.
418,10,"When the walls were already built up under the roof, the house seemed very high, especially if you looked from under the mountains, because the building was in a slope and the basement was on the lower side, from the courtyard, came out almost the entire floor."

419,4,"The old woman is a personal couple, talking badly, lisping."
419,5,"“Look at that, Petrushka, I want to say to you: you’re building a great house in vain."
419,6,It’s better to build a small one just for yourself.
419,7,"For that you’re such a big one, you’re the only son from your father and mother, but uncle can Pavel to live in Moscow, go ahead and scrawl: you built such a big one, take it yourself, and I’ll take the money in return, I don’t need much money in Moscow."
419,8,"If you have some money, go to Moscow again, and you with a big house, and you’ll be left without money .. What will you do then."
419,9,"Remember me then, old woman. """
419,10,"I started, it was, to prove to her that we are Paul."
419,11,"by agreement, we are building together, and this house is no larger than our diligent house, which we are with."
419,12,"Pavels, too, by agreement agreed to step aside for a certain amount of money to Stepan’s younger brothers, and all of this is framed in a written agreement for Agniya Maksimovna to say: ""I understand your written agreements poorly, but from experience it’s a sign that two BE owners do not live together ""Sooner or later they disperse."
419,13,"So it’s better to build two small houses at once, but mine was just to say the same, but whatever you like, do it, my part is""."
419,14,I see whether it is useless to argue or convince her.
419,15,"To thank her for her advice and wishes, but unfortunately, the house is almost being built up and impossible to change.The brickwork is over."
419,16,"According to conventional wisdom, in winter the walls stood and froze, and in the spring"

420,4,"200 or 300, and there, where they took sand, pits were formed, we covered them with a burnt-up hollow, which was located next to these pits on the outskirts of the forest and lay a huge mountain.For laying the stoves, Pavel F. bought at the Nizhny Novgorod fair from handicraftsmen peasants of the Nizhny Novgorod district a tile of medium quality, and sent it with a towing boat and Bulychev's steamers, so that they were inexpensive."
420,5,"But at that time, not only Nashi Velyak, but even Vyatka, almost no tiled stoves."

447,10,In water.
447,11,Then the additional officers
448,0,make a good impression on those understood and these are the protocols.
448,1,"I called out 4 villages of Sopsky and Tensky and handed over to them all on the shore and on the water under guard for two days, saying that immediately, probably, there would be a new police officer, or righteous man himself, for this is already a riot."

448,8,"”Then the nicknames suggested the camp, the bailiff himself tomorrow go to Borovitsa, We’ll cover the villages, familiarize them with the law and locally establish whether Vakhrushevsky and logs and only bi-chevniks are occupied, or if only part of the land belonging to the peasants of the villages of 11rokosha and Skolotnya, and if such is discovered, then the peasant land immediately to release, oblige Vakhrushev to remove logs for scourging, and to satisfy the peasants for temporary use of the land.The order was given an order so that the next day at 9 o’clock."
448,9,"In the morning, all the landlords were gathered from the villages of Skolotni and Prokosheva"
449,0,"Borovitsa and 2-3 more neighboring villages - Batashi and friend, to invite 3-4 people by witnesses.The new police officer N. A. Dumarevskiy prichal on Borovitsa was neatly 9 o’clock, and I prihal alin was ten early."
449,1,snakes were all in the collection.
449,2,"il having been with us, N. A."
449,3,"Du Marevsky went to inspect, where he rolled out."
449,4,"Measured the distance The current riot or piles of forest to summer water at present, measured the area occupied by my logs, all recorded."
449,5,He asked the peasants and witnesses to show how much water had come to the place before in the spring.
449,6,"It turned out that up to the steep coast, and partly even water came out and steep to the steep."
449,7,I’ve made a recording and this is a provocation.
449,8,"I read everything in all directions of the chanie, invited the attendants and to sign, argue, pay attention to one hundred rubles, and then descendants to those who were understood .. Read all."
449,9,"to those present for the horse, and then conclude that Vakhrushevsky was unloaded with water below the scavenger in slopes on the sand, and the scourge, based on the law of this article, is considered to be 10 saғ from the highest spring water flow, as well as water 10 soot are legally considered to be on a steep coast and a scourge."
449,10,"Deep into steep coast from us, it turns out to be completely free, nothing to occupy."
449,11,So not the lands personally owned by peasants.
449,12,"the village of Rokulen and Prokosha, Vakhrushev is not at all busy, and therefore knows that the protocol drawn up by the officer himself and the authorities and the insults of the officer and Vakhruinev is correctly drawn up and is forwarded to such a judge Shepelevsky."
449,13,"Some cartoons oro fought, they agreed to ask for a percentage and stop the bottom, and the main troublemakers and throats began to scold them too, that you were afraid of some kind of stan, we will go to"
450,0,"the governor, and even before the king doy virgins, we will find the laws on rich breeders."
450,1,"It’s impossible to condemn all of us, not enough for 50 people in the administration and the prison room, not to imprison two villages at once for judging."

450,6,"Of course, there isn’t enough space in the board of directors, but it’s rare to divide the execution of the sentence into groups of 10-15 people."
450,7,I personally didn’t give a judge.
450,8,"The detachment - nickname - spoke out on the part of the accusation for arbitrariness and insult, I have no reason to be sure that there was no case of conscious admiration for our guilt and at the request of a unanimous percentage, to end this was peaceful, to forgive all and at a loss we will not seek.At the trial, on the proposal of the court chairman on reconciliation, the peasants firmly stated that they did not consider themselves guilty and not only ask for a percentage, but we would even ask for Vakhrushev and from the bailiff for the bribes we had already spent collecting two villages: ashore, then, now, today, the government called, to tear us from left work."
450,9,This caused nan more losses.
450,10,"According to the peasant custom, the volost judge tries to reconcile the parties, three times to the two parties."
450,11,"make peace, leave for 5-10 minutes from the court to talk privately about the world’s conditions."
450,12,Unit -
451,0,"- Nick stated that he and the second II ONE-MIND AUTHOR Vakhrunev himself:prepare for the world, under the condition of the number-hearted consciousness of your Mistake and your arrogance uttered offensive words."
451,1,"Skolotni and Prokovi rested on their own people, who did not acknowledge anything and did not repent, but, on the contrary, consider themselves rights and victims."
451,2,"The court ruled: * All 50 people are found guilty of saylo governing and insulting, be liable to leave you in custody for the volost government 110 for fifteen days, and the penalty was incurred by Nykh Vakhrushev and Fedor."

451,4,Representation of the Supreme Commander.

451,6,the appointed time.
451,7,"the decision of the volost court, the men appealed to the Zemsky on the boss."

484,11,"I asked my dad; they do not wantto part with his beloved horse, but for the zemstvo chief, it was considered inconvenient to refuse - to give at the cost of eighty rubles, apart from the fact that they fed and kept them for three years, they almost did not live."

514,17,"Timofey Semenovich’s children had only four daughters,"

520,12,"But he didn’t offer us this, and I didn’t bother to send this offer to him through anyone and I didn’t dare to tell him directly about this."
520,13,"So my secret thought remained unfulfilled.Open the shop, I had to trade, Ilya Tim."
520,14,troubles began.
520,15,"They began to hate me and the steel of our company, where it’s possible to harm and spread personally and through"

521,6,You can be good at the fa client and give her a percentage.
521,7,"By common efforts we took the goods, three or three, and brought a whole take."
521,8,"I didn’t pay money, of course, but Torochkov convinced A.G. Grigov that it wasn’t suitable, and money could be waited for by II.A."
521,9,Vakhru Sheva.
521,10,"When they brought the goods from Torochkov, I, who didn’t understand the shopkeeper yet, said: I don’t have to sell five belts BE BE for five years."
521,11,Ivan Nick.
521,12,Ukhov also confirmed that Ilya Tim had a shop.
521,13,"five hundred rubles a year were sold for these goods, but no more."
521,14,We proposed Al.
521,15,"G. Grѣkhova, together with Ivan."
521,16,"Ukhov, of all"
522,0,"to bring back the brought only more running gear, and in limited quantities, and the rest should be returned."
522,1,"I, having handered according to my wishes to Vyatka, went to Torochkova and said that we would return the most part of the goods, because A.G. Grkhova thought through rural fairs, not knowing the clientele of our region, but the senior clerk, knowing the whole region , to say that some goods you won’t be able to go away at all, and some are very few, and only have to take a seat in the store, gather dust and make yourself worthless."
522,2,"After talking about everything, finally, the Torochkovs agreed: ""Leave what is needed, but return the unnecessary."""
522,3,Leaving.
522,4,"rubles for 600, everything else was returned to Torochkova without any troubles, and as a result, some needle goods bought from him for 200 or 300 BI years, but not more."

523,3,"Plunov’s calculations went from year to year, not more than once a year."
523,4,They submitted bills in front of the Nizhny Novgorod Fair.
523,5,"Sometimes we paid them at the fair in full or in part, and sometimes we asked to wait until November or December and they never protested, they always kindly agreed, so the shop didn’t require any working capital for me and it was easy to do this, but with the service staff not a little difficult."
523,6,Eve Nick.
523,7,"Ear, there were already old people, quiet."
523,8,Al.
523,9,Gavr.
523,10,"For some reason, Grѣkhova soon left."
523,11,"During her stay, as early as the first month of service, we learned that in Slobodskoye, at the dairy factory, the shag rose in price by one and a half rubles in a boxѣ, and therefore at the same time all traders increased the price by 2 rubles in a boxѣ."
523,12,"We didn’t have a reserve and on this day we just went to Slobodskaya, just wanted to bring a box of 5 or 10."
523,13,"Ukhov returned from E Slobodsky, bought only a little box and told me that Ilya had a box - about a hundred."
523,14,"They still don’t know the new value, about so far give on the old price."
523,15,"You can’t buy anything from them, but it’s inconvenient to go a lot, they are angry with me and they guessed at all."
523,16,"""Alexandra Gavr."
523,17,"Grѣkhova said that she didn’t know her, she went and bought - it would say that she was Vyatka."
523,18,"She dressed on the road, came to their shop, said that she had heard that they were buying wholesale at the Nizhny Novgorod Fair and they were no more expensive to shop than the Sloboda factory, then I would like to find out the price and buy one or two."
523,19,what
524,0,"they have a large stock, willingly sell two carts."
524,1,"Assigned an old price, but only for cash."
524,2,"Grkhova said: “Perhaps this price is suitable, but I would like to have a look at others, if it’s impossible to get the two-headed one out of the box."
524,3,"I’ll go to the next shop and I’ll manage the house.” Her clerk said that they had stock big ones, they buy 2-3 boxes each at Slobodsky or Vyatka, ""you don’t buy anything there, but to check our words, go and take a look."""
524,4,"Grikhova come and say many things: “Give 2 carts, 50 box."
524,5,according to the old price.
524,6,Let's get the money soon.
524,7,”I gave her 500 rubles.
524,8,"She returned and said:“ You are right, they have nothing to pass on."
524,9,"Sing demte into the barn, indicate which boxes are many - let them go: are they whole, not broken, and aren’t soaked."
524,10,"""They went into the warehouse, she counted how much they had in stock.” It turned out to be a little over sixty."
524,11,"I returned to the shop, demanded to write an account with stamps, paid the bill in full."
524,12,The order was growing and I received money.
524,13,"Grѣkhova gave me the Rusanova’s money, hired two carriages, loaded 50 boxes on carts and drove you Vyatka."
524,14,You reach Ivan Prokofievich Rusanov.
524,15,"My name’s father put the boxes in his “barn” until evening, and when it got dark, all 50 boxes were transported on our horses by the way."
524,16,"We were all interested in the invasion for 75 rubles, but we were very happy that they deftly outperformed our competitor."
524,17,"And two days later, they found out that it was ours trick and that this is all the result of higher prices for the factory."
524,18,"They were very dissatisfied, and Ilya and his sons were even more angry with me."
524,19,"After AG Grѣkhova, the wife of our accountant, Augusta, came to our shop regarding our orphanage"
525,0,"Mikhailovna Ivanova, 10 rubles a month."
525,1,She worked for a year.
525,2,Then Yves.
525,3,Nick.
525,4,"Wow, Ilyich’s father lured us into Glagov, BE clerks to Bihail Natvievich Stolbov."
525,5,"We took a temporary clerk, Vyatka, I don’t remember his last name, Augusta Mikhailovna refused to cash."
525,6,You took cashier Nadezhda Mikhailovna Selvakova / nee Oparina /.
525,7,"She didn’t know the merchant, and the clerk of the new was bad at drinking and drinking."
525,8,"It seemed that it was completely not to go, or it would obviously give a loss."
525,9,"Then Aleksandr Aleksandrovichi Case Nin, the need of my cousin Elizaveta Alekseevna as a case, recommended that we take as a clerk his bastard bail from A.V."
525,10,"Bashmakov, a young man of about 20 years old, a peasant from the village of Bobinskago, Aleks Fedorovich Babintsev, who, it turned out, knew well and knew how to attract customers."
525,11,"Pil came to us, lord, for the old man of the clerk and for the cashier, but began to keep him two boy-looser."
525,12,"Things went well, and they continued to serve ten at our place."
525,13,"Laundry gave us an annual rate of 1,200 to 1,500 rubles."
525,14,"pure benefit, without requiring me to spend 88 material resources."
525,15,and your personal work.
525,16,"The first time we were willing to go to the shop to help you, soon because of curiosity, like a new child."
525,17,"the toy was of interest, then they began to help only after Sunday, after the days when the people from the church, after the liturgy were crowded, filled the crowd."
525,18,"Then the clerks and the boys all the time, they try to satisfy everyone as soon as possible, so that those who don’t expect can’t leave for 13 payback."
525,19,Then we went to help at least cash and ensure that no one left without calculation.
526,0,"But in the aftermath, under Babintsev, we ourselves began to come to the shop less often and more rarely, and he adapted and managed with his assistants, coped without nasi.The shop in the name of Apollinarіy Alekseevna many benefited not only from gaining from 1200 to 1500 rubles."
526,1,"per year, but it made me easier in financial terms: I, while maintaining a fixed and good relationship with the director."
526,2,"Vyatskago Veretennikovskogo Bank, Ilya Nikodimovich."
526,3,"Zheludkovym, every year bought through it rye flour for the plant, and partly for the shop."
526,4,"At one time I turned to him for advice that, in addition to the trading house, I personally have my own trading business for IVAI’s wife, and for this additional working capital is needed."
526,5,"Could it be possible to open, apart from the trading house, a separate loan in the name of Apollinarii Alekseevna Vakhrusheva."
526,6,"De goods for the shop we buy part from Suntsova, flour from Vas, drying from Korobov, and so on."
526,7,Ilya Nikodimovich said: “Submit a statement signed by Apollinar Al.
526,8,"Vakhrusheva, and ask them to sign Suntsova and someone else."
526,9,"I hope that you can open loans until 5,000 rubles, and then, after E year, you can increase if necessary” ."
526,10,So they did.
526,11,"Immediately according to the recommendations made by Suntsov and Korobov, they opened a loan of 5000 rubles."
526,12,"A year later, they increased to 10,000 rubles, and another two years later they increased to 15,000 rubles: Thus, thanks to the shop, I used collateral loans of up to fifteen thousand rubles for b 1/2%."
526,13,"This greatly facilitated the financially material situation of his firm  trade house ""F.T."
526,14,"Wahru Sheva S.I."""
526,15,"For I have repeatedly written above that Yai Pavel F., in the first year after the death of Fedor Timofeevich, was sent"
527,0,overspending on weddings.
527,1,"For these cost overruns, we paid 6% of the company for 7%, but this was not limited."
527,2,"Two years later, with us."
527,3,there were weddings again - I gave Anna Aleksandrovna all for Vlad Sergey.
527,4,"ilina, and Pavel Fed."
527,5,"gave the second daughter, Mariya Pavlovna, bio bio well, for Pavel Vasilyevich Martynov."
527,6,"Again, against us, Stepan had a large over-expenditure, and again, %% was accrued on us."
527,7,"In addition, we received only 4000 of the company’s earnings for the construction of the house, allegedly for equalizing with the old  ским ским ским house, which we left to Stepan and his brothers, and the initial cost of a new house ’on the highway cost us 18,000 rubles."
527,8,"Thus, we sent an overrun up to 14,000 rubles to the house, i.e."
527,9,7000 for me and s. Pavel F. We were obliged to pay interest for the eshi amount.
527,10,"But Stepan, in parallel, also began to choose the company’s company every year for 3000-5000 extra and put aside a bank in the name of his vein, and then out of these sums he built on the track, next to us, a new house for himself, and the old I left the house for Ivan and Vasiliy."
527,11,"But our expenditures and the choice of capital from the company still exceeded, and I still partially helped the son-in-law, Vladimir Sergeyevich Zhilin, from buying up parts of the factory and the house of Ivan and Ilya Sergeyev, so that it was very difficult to turn around I’m financially related, then I would have had an overrun not only against it."
527,12,"Stepan's brothers, and also against Paul."
527,13,"Yes, moreover, the company did not prevent the company from overspending for weddings and building a house, paying 7% of it, but to my personal shop and to my son-in-law V.S."
527,14,"To Ilin, of course, in no case did the firm have the power to choose capital from the general business."
527,15,So I
528,0,"having, through the shop, a loan to a bank in the name of his wife, were almost equal to the rest of the members of the trading house."
528,1,I took a century to register with Veretennikovsky Bank in the name of Ap.Al.
528,2,"Vakhru Sheva I signed with Alexander Alexandrovich Kazenin, who, having married my cousin Elizavet Alek ѣevnѣ Kazenina, left the service from: Alexey Vasilyevich Bashmakov, bought from the city of Vyat bridge the house and opened the fish and grocery trade in the guest room, near the Cathedral Square."
528,3,"Part of the money is far from him, however, to take us, Ivan Alekseyevich Kazenin, who at that time was bugging or BE Moscow from the Makarovs."
528,4,"His father, Alexei Ivanovich Kazenin, had BE Vyatka, a living room nearby, a shop merged in the name of Alexei Ivanovich Kazenin, although it actually belonged to all the sons of Ivan Andrianovich Kazenin, but after the death of Alexei Ivanovich, that shop, according to inheritance, was transferred Kazenin."
528,5,"While they were young, Petr Ivanovich kazenin ordered a senior to take his father by renting a bench for rent to Perestoranin, receiving a completely rented body - that’s all, and disregarding this amount for the maintenance of himself and his family, as well as the family of his brother Alexei Ivanovich."
528,6,"When Il'etr Ivanovich died and reached the perfection of Ivan Alekseyevich, he was offered to establish himself in the rights of inheritance and dispose of the shop."
528,7,"They considered it more profitable to sell the shop to Alec to Sandra Andreyevich Khlbnikov for 10,000 rubles: and the money was transferred to: the sister’s husband, i.e."
528,8,"Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Kazenin, who still had his small funds backed up."
528,9,"Thus, he also made a purchase of a house and opened a fish and grocery store."
528,10,"But he also needed a loan from Bakov, for the higher decree"
529,0,Amounts paid were not enough for business.
529,1,"I assisted him through the same I.N.Zheludkov to open a loan in his name and we, together with him, the name of Apollinarii Alekseevna, were credited to the Vyatka public Veretennikovsky bank.When the consecration of the temple was in: our village, we still lived in the old house, at the factory."
529,2,"Soon after the consecration of our church, His Grace Archbishop Sergius was from Vyatka re-entry into Astrakhan."
529,3,"His clergy Bishops Barsanuphius temporarily drove in, and on the other hand, he was appointed priest of Vyatka, appointed to the cafe there is the Cathedral of the Archbishop Alexy."
529,4,"At this time, the entire Wahra Sheva, the builders of the temple, received monastic rewards for the construction of the temple, including my father, Alexander Fedorovich., PavelFed."
529,5,and Stegan Fed.
529,6,"received a gold medal for the chest, and Vasily and Timofey Parfenovichi - for a silver medal for the chest."
529,7,Ilya and Ivan Timofeevich get a big medal on the neck.
529,8,"That is why Ilya Timofeevich suspected that with a passionate presentation of the awards to our new rector of the church, Father Nikolai Dobrovolskago."
529,9,"For Parfenovichi donated a large sum for the initial construction, and Fedorovichi - half as much."
529,10,According to Ilya Tim.
529,11,"Parfenovich should give gold medals, and Fedorovich - silver on the chest."
529,12,"But, apparently, Father Nikolai Dobrovolsky, when introducing, emphasized that the feudalists, apart from participating in the construction of the entire church, at the same time at their own expense, were set aside for the church under construction, fully equipped with everything necessary for worship, sanctified and, until the whole the construction of the temple, in this case, during the service, half a year"
530,0,"So it was, or else - I can not vouch, but the facts are on the face: Fedorovich received the highest award against the liarfenovich."
530,1,"For this, Ilya, t. Did not like the rector of the temple."
530,2,Soon we moved to a new house and immediately opened it under the house.
530,3,"shop in the name of Apollinarіy Alekseevna, taking Ilya T. dismissed them."
530,4,clerk Ukhova.
530,5,Then Ilya Tim.
530,6,He hated me.
530,7,"In our newly opened shop, they began to buy everything for testing, like a merchant’s car."
530,8,"Then, to the new priest, Father Nikolai Dobrovolskiy, they began to buy part of it in our shop, but partly in the shop of Ilya Tivi."
530,9,Then Ilya Tim.
530,10,finally hated father Nicholas voluntarily.
530,11,"Partly still because Father Nikolai Dobrovolsky had an invitation to the village at the stand on the recommendation of Dmitry Palovich Suslolarov, father-in-lawIkhail Ivanovich Vakhrushev."
530,12,"When the construction of the temple was going on, all the builders of the temple, the brothers Vakhrush, you lived meh_d in yourselves peacefully and peacefully, and everything came up with general agreement."
530,13,"* His Grace Sergiy, even on the foundation of the church, said: “You should look for a priest in advance, send yourself to try different villages."
530,14,"If you like it, you’ll go to the center, together, please."
530,15,"If it turns out worthy, then I and him appoint ""."
530,16,"After the recommendation of Susloparov, Vakhrushe invited Father Nikolai Dobrovolskago to serve a trial and trial in the basement of our church."
530,17,I liked his service.
530,18,"Then Ivan Tim., At the time of signing all the builders of the church, signed with his father and Nikolai Dobrovol, blessed His Grace Blessed Sergius, and then Dobrovolsky was appointed rector in the newly opened parish."
530,19,"First, Ilya Tim."
530,20,belonged to father Nikolai Dobrovolsky
531,0,good and in all were im content.
531,1,But when happened between Ilya and Ivan.
531,2,"Timofeevichs first troubles because of the same for their daughters, Mikhail Matv Столevich Stolbov, then Ilya T. and Ivan T. hated each other and through it Ilya T. from the relationship with the chosen one is important!"
531,3,"by Ivan Timofeevichy, priest of Dobrovolsky."
531,4,"And for that reason, due to the reasons listed above, it came to the point that you served only one church, one - the head priest, the other - the church headman, almost did not talk to all the others, except for official need."
531,5,Ilya Tim.
531,6,"finally stopped visiting the priest and E ce wasn’t invited, except for the special corrections required or glorified iii.When the new Archbishop Alexy arrived at the diocese, then Father Nikolai Dobrovolsky vs Bakhrushevs reminded us that we should meet each other, by the way, thank you for the presentation of the KE monarch’s award."
531,7,"But almost all of them refused to go to Vyatka, considering it too overwhelming for themselves as important dloms, never having been with the Archіereevs and some peasants without leaders."

531,10,"1 Indeed, soon Vladyka was a khalker from Vyatka to Sloboda, warning that he would touch a new village as well."

532,5,Lord.
532,6,"Archpriest Porfi ryov asked the Lord, and the Lord said:; “Let them blow that da-yak into the house of the church elder, the abbot will present them, and then I will ask them”, then Father Nikolai Dobro - Volsky sent a psalm-keeper to inform Rb all."

534,7,"He was for strength and for the future time to go to him, but never asked anything about Ilya Timofeevich."
534,8,"The next day, Sunday, about 3 p.m., I once went to visit my father, Protopriest Peter Por Firyev."
534,9,"We sat there for half an hour, talking to those abstract we."
534,10,"Later, the father of proto-Yrey asks me: “Well, all builders."
534,11,"Vakhrushev likes the rector of your church, Father Nikolai Dobrovolskiy."
534,12,"Or maybe he has some kind of aggravated relationship.” I, not expecting such a question, hesitated and said: ""As you know, Father Nikolai Dobrovolsky has always taken a step."
534,13,"Vakhrushev liked it and all the builders have asked before Vladyka Sergiy to appoint him Our church is the head priest, and, it seems, after thatmore familiar with CE NI ME, CE his family and his church serviceZhenіem, they were not at all disappointed in their first day to impress him, but on the contrary, they all loved him and he became friends with everyone, he was very kind and kind."

535,4,"the priest, who, allegedly, is all dissatisfied."
535,5,"Of course, Vladyka was not far from the final communion with him, but they explained that without E reasons and without the personal consent of the abbot, BE Orthodox dioceses are not supposed to and are not accepted to translate the infusions from the parish of the Entrance."

535,7,"""I suggested to the father Archpriest to request letters from the rest of the builders of the Vakhrushevs temple."
535,8,"“You will see that apart from the family of Ilya Tim., Everyone will even ask and intercede, so as not to transfer Father Nikolay Dobrovolskago from our village, but rather, if possible, encourage him with insignia.” Father Archpriest again asks: "" But, you were assured for all the rest, that would be averted if Vladika had resolved a lot of tricks about the unspoken questioning of all the builders of the church."
535,9,"If you are firmly convinced that everything will be disrespectful as you say, then Vlad will be very happy, and I will report to him about our conversation."
535,10,"""I reaffirmed that there’s more, more confidence."""
535,11,"If you ask by letter, then address to a name older"

537,3,In no case can I give him an offer to translate an increase.

538,4,"Personally, when I went to Nizhny Novgorod, Irbit, Tyumen, or Petropavlovsk fairs to buy raw materials, each time I took with me rubles for a thousand postage stamps and rubles for five hundred bill papers and stamps, and my friends distributed them to the fair."

538,7,"Pick up five hundred rubles and carry it all to your Tatars merchants, give out 50 rubles, 25 rubles."
538,8,"On the next day, I should bring in completely five hundred rubles, or even ask for the rest of the brands, so there was almost no trouble or inconvenience from this person personally, and for this reason I could do a great deal of detachment."
538,9,"Soon after, it was listed two categories higher and put to us."
538,10,"the best postal and telegraph director, Alexey Alexandrovich Levashov, with experienced telegraph assistantѣ."
538,11,Through it I found out that it is possible to send mail to a far distance

539,6,"Vyatka post office began to protest that they could not temporarily increase the number to shady, because Such sending is not regular all year round, but temporary, for 1-2 or 3 months."

540,12,For this he still paid 20 rubles.
540,13,"For all the summers, two mares lacked grass for all summers."
540,14,"In addition, 50 rubles per year was spent for mares of oats and oatmeal in the pot; in order to give more milk, it is recommended to milk the face cows and cow better, and drink with CE not an additive of flour - oatmeal."
540,15,"So kumys nam, for this summer, cost about 250 rubles; we drank with the whole family, and we drank little children.Next, they drank goat milk and cow milk with good cognac."
540,16,"According to the doctor’s advice - did you pour a teaspoon of cognac on a glass of milk, and it would seem to replace koumiss.,"
541,0,"approximately, but not completely; kumi si is nevertheless recognized as more beneficial for the health of weak breasts.For the next summer, I rented a hole from our clergy, near Fr."

542,4,"For the first summer of our year, koumiss treatment, I bought a foal-mare foil, one-piece, I donated to Anton Anisimovich Nosov, because in our whole village it was not customary to keep mare horses, and since Fran Zholitsa got rid of were from a good stallion with."

576,10,"All of us and the peasants will be very trustworthyall to come with me, but not with kem or others."
576,11,"""But there is nothing to do - I suggested going to the stations of the railway Almezhy and Oparino, inspecting where the willow shrub, or trees, and what quality should be grown."
576,12,"N. Agalakov ubudil me, that there’s nothing to see, because the willow trees grow all over the forest on the distance and two hundred versts along the railway line."
576,13,They will be obi -
577,0,"To work with artels, first approaching the line or station, - who want to capture the site, and then E gradually retreating in depth: the forest is 5 and up to 10 versts."
577,1,"On the place, you will knit bunches into a manka and hang them on the beds, dry them, and then put the wine on your shoulders, and hand them over to you."
577,2,"Your business will only be worth everything and money at the station, inspect, weigh and pay money, and the rest I will equip everything and at all times - I will talk with the conductors."
577,3,Ahead of money.
577,4,"You do not give anyone, there is no risk at all."
577,5,"10 every time you go at your own expense, you go out one week and after two days, ""I see - there is no other way out, I have to agree."
577,6,I said.
577,7,"Nikon Agalako to collect the artel and go back to our factory a few weeks later.Upon returning home, I informed Stepan ed."
577,8,"He began to convince himself not to stand in front of people to climb into the forest, not knowing that there would be, what quality of the bark and at what value it would cost."
577,9,"Let them kick themselves and bring BE Vyatka, then we'll see."
577,10,"I began to prove that up to Kotlas, it’s supposedly, at a distance of 200-300 versts, you can hear: there’s bark everywhere, no one bought it, and therefore 11 didn’t rip off anyone, and if we try to leave at least one station first , then Nikon Agalakov will already organize an artel BE 100-200 people."
577,11,"We allwe will be guaranteed that at least 5 or 10,000 pounds."
577,12,hope.
577,13,rut.
577,14,"What have we got through E Nicon, we warn ME that the old-Koryawe won’t peel the willow trees, we won’t accept the thick, hard bark, and since there will be no competition, we can sort them out as you like, and immediately teach them to rip off only the one that suits us - for them and for will be"
578,0,profitable.
578,1,"Anton Anisimovich Nosov supported my arguments, saying that because of this alone it is necessary to go with the dealers in the first place."
578,2,"In each case, it’s better for a person to learn again how you need to retrain from - if you want to reclaim his old ones for our new requirements."
578,3,"Finally, after a long stubbornness of persistence, Stepan Fedorovich said: ""Well, don’t, as you wish for your responsibility, take it and take it, we’ll take care of these things, I’ll never go there for this matter."""
578,4,After a week {icon Agalakov again appeared.
578,5,"If you tell us that you obhali your volost, whom you have onstood and the people promise to go, it is hoped that at least 200 people will gather."
578,6,"“But you need to go to the Almezha station not earlier than 3-4 weeks later, but for now, if you give many rubles a hundred on the makings, it would not be useless either.” Papa Alexandr Fedorovich, listening to his conversations, said: “ I myself will ask Nikon Aga to buy varnish and I will give the makings myself."
578,7,"""Nikon Agalakov began to convince him;"" It’s too early for you to go, and getting to our village is difficult and useless."
578,8,On horseback.
578,9,"Drive, or go on foot."
578,10,"You can not""."
578,11,"But dad, despite my beliefs that in his years it was unthinkable to go to such a wilderness, and so far without the need for it; ""it’s better then, when there’s already a purchase, you’ll sit and watch."""
578,12,"But he began to take offense: “You can, but I think I won’t be able to."
578,13,"For whom you think I am, I’m a peasant too, and I have 30 versions of Alkival and horse zdil, and prayer and land pa hal, and You didn’t work it. """
578,14,I see that further conversations only build it more than once.
578,15,"I say: ""I’ll come tomorrow with Nikon Agalakovyl."
578,16,"Although it’s too early, you’ll live with him for 2-3 weeks."
578,17,Take
579,0,"we need 200 rubles with you, if you need some money, then through Nikon Agalakov, give parts of his receipts to him, and then, when you transfer to the railway line, we will sell it and we will bring more money."
579,1,"”Palace, c. Pleasure gathered and squealed with N. Agalakov."
579,2,"Later Nikone Agalakov told that Pinyug hal old man was cheerful and fun, and when he had to sit on a thin horse, he was embarrassed."
579,3,"When he jumped twice, he ate the horse twice."
579,4,"but fortunately we were walking near the conductor, grabbing or holding him and then they all walked quietly and only reached the Agalakov village by night."
579,5,"Two days later dad lived with Nikon Agalakov, who didn’t do anything."
579,6,"In the morning we will get tea, go out to the lockers of the house, sit on the other’s side, look up and up , to heaven, returns to the hut, lies down."
579,7,"Having won - To sleep, again to go out into the locker for an hour or two, and again back."
579,8,So I studied for two weeks.
579,9,"I told Nikon Agalakov: ""Take me to the railroad, I will go home to Troitsyn at the day, you have a church in Neti, and I, I wish you such a great holiday to go to church pour ""."
579,10,"N. Agalakov was afraid of letting him go alone, so that something would not happen on the way, and there would be no reprimand from me for not having taken the old man to Vyatka."
579,11,"Agalakov said that by the way, he was about to go to Vyatka, so take it together, and there, perhaps, you’ll reach your village at the same time."
579,12,"""On the eve of the Trinity, we see - daddy N. Agalakov drive up to our house."
579,13,"You sat down a couple of zemstvo horses, unexpectedly."
579,14,"When we saw through the window, at first we were afraid that something had happened to the old man."
579,15,"We pulled out - we met on the porch, we asked what had happened."
579,16,Why unexpectedly we left without warning.
579,17,We don’t have enough money -
580,0,lo.
580,1,"ilariasha rejects that they went to Trinity Day to pray, because there is nothing to do there yet, and the church is not."
580,2,"money is not necessary, for all are all."
580,3,"Nikon Agalakov whispered that “the old man really missed you and forcibly waited for the holiday, if you wanted to leave me alone, but I didn’t let go of one, decided to talk, and tomorrow I’ll be back."
580,4,After a week I’ll have to be cut off.” I approved that he escorted the palace and invited him to stay with us.
580,5,"Trinity and the Spirit of the day, and eclipse on my own behalf I went to the yatka, take it to Vyatka and communicated in a matter of weeks to send to Almekh."
580,6,"Anton Aii llo owl, and pray to be, prі du samі."
580,7,Before departure.
580,8,"Nikon Agalakov, while saying goodbye to the CE fell, suggested: ""Kak, Alexander Fedorovich, will you come up with a lot of things."""
580,9,"They averted: “No, let my son eat: he is younger, and I will stay at home."
580,10,"Then there will be a lot there, I will, and if I need, then I can write, maybe I will come, Only your way is not important, so it bothered me that I will not forget to death. """
580,11,So more dad didn’t go anywhere to buy korya or otherwise giѣl dѣlam.
580,12,This trip finally convinced him that he was already outdated for the present.
580,13,"If someone addresses him with a serious business question, he won’t say that I don’t know, but deny: “Go, ask my son, please, he’ll be careful and eat, and they’ll follow them after that and I’ve already worked out before."
580,14,I’ve had enough of it at home.
580,15,"Look, after the factory’s address, and thank God. """
580,16,In a week I will go along Khal with Antonom Anis.
580,17,"Nosov on Almezh, they took with them weights and weights and everything necessary."
580,18,"Come to Almeh, station to the swamp, not a single apartment, except station."
580,19,"Not far from the station, a small hut of a fox stand empty, but"
581,0,"there is one window without a frame and glass that closes on the same level, and one door is small for the entrance, which you must enter by bending down."
581,1,"Inside there is no stove, no floor, no table, no bench."
581,2,"Having talked with the chief of the station: like, at least for the first time somewhere to spend the night 1-2 nights, and then, if possible, we will arrange a tent from our tarpaulin near the station hut."
581,3,"The station manager will advise you to repair the oval from the bush of the forester and place it in it, and for the first time you can chew the feather on a wooden sofa, in general, lounge, coming to the station."
581,4,I thankfully accepted this offer.
581,5,An.
581,6,An.
581,7,Wear and Nick.
581,8,"Agalakov, along with axes and a saw, immediately set up huts, circles, a wide bench for 3 or 4 people to sleep on, and arranged in the middle for food and tea, at one corner made fires for cooking and porridge, in the rain, and in dry weather, bonfires for cooking the second were arranged on the streets, near the huts."
581,9,"But the bonfires inside the hut were served almost every evening, because the area on Almezh is swampy, there are so many mosquitoes that you can’t walk or sleep day and night, and therefore, before evening, we lit a small fire in the hut from E or fir."
581,10,It turned out a lot of smoke and all mosquitoes flew out of the hut or died.
581,11,"We then went into the hut, closed the window and door with the shutters."
581,12,"They lit a lamp brought with them, sat down around a table, had dinner, and then went around in a circle."
581,13,the arrow lay on a wide bench and slept.
581,14,So I'm at the camp - I spent the night only one night.
581,15,"It was better to sleep in the hut after the fire, mosquitoes did not bother."
581,16,"In the afternoon, mosquitoes also strongly but bit."
581,17,"I, at the first trip, you Vyatka, bought a land"
582,0,"five and six beekeeping hats with a net, and a whole day we went to these hats."
582,1,"But workers are accustomed to it, or their face and hands are so tanned and."
582,2,hardened skin that they didn’t close and didn’t feel: apparently a mosquito bite ..
582,3,"They slept all the way down, where they teared off, each made a little hut out of the willow tree or coniferous tree for their family, and the majority lay right on earth, open air."
582,4,Near the station there was no commodity platform and large loads for cargo transportation.
582,5,"We set two poles with a crossbeam, on the starting line indicated by the nickname station, suspended the weight and set the poles to the style of the floor for the storehouse of dry accepted bark, so that in the case of wet weather the ground would not get wet and would not bark."
582,6,"For the first time, we had almost no large canvas."
582,7,"At our request, the head of the station requested large stations or from Perm a dozen railcar tarpaulins."
582,8,"A week later, the dealers began to deliver dry ear to the station."
582,9,"Dy, accepting the measles, immediately paid each person small money in their hands, which was very convenient for them and they really liked it."
582,10,"It turns out that before the time of the badge / door, some of these people were in these small artels."
582,11,"Pound pounds of 100-150, hang them on the beds and leave until the wasp."
582,12,"When the first shot falls out, they again drive into the forest with the same artel, demolish all the bark they have prepared for the big passing road, load it on a sled and drive horses to Vyatka or Slobodskaya to the plants."
582,13,"Thus, they got the money into the hands of the priest only six months after the removal, and the majority even through the second hands, through the buyers, because not everyone had 100"
583,0,150 pounds of horse to drive themselves to Vyatka.
583,1,"And therefore, because of their own environment, there were those who wanted to buy half the price from many, and even to give money."
583,2,"it’s a tenth of a hundred and on the awnings, like a deposit, and the rest - after the sale, i.e."
583,3,upon return from E Vyatka.
583,4,Such buyers brought up to train.
583,5,"/ d we have lots up to 1000-1500 poods, and we bought them in November, under the name Permyatskoe or Vologda Korye.Now that the distributors saw that they had a quick start earning money, having worked for a week, on Sunday they had money and pocket; they did not limit themselves to 100-150 pounds, which gave the artel an attempt to triple or put the quantity down."
583,6,"HER the end of the month - the season of ripping off, with a cut, they returned home all with money, felt great wealth and it was very grateful to Nikon Mikheevich Agalakov that they had made it and called the big breeders to buy them a place,After sending the first carriages to Almezha, I myself gave VE Vyatka."
583,7,"It turned out that Vyatka railway the station doesn’t let the bark into the commodity warehouses, like bulky goods, little * valuable and combustible."
583,8,"They unloaded it on the ground near the line, but did they immediately, within 2-3 days, take out or rent out areas near the station for a temporary storage of measles, which can last more than three days."
583,9,"Taking into account that measles will arrive almost daily, and during the haying season, carriage of peasants is small and very expensive, I rented three sections in a row for three months in a row, onto which the measles were unloaded directly."
583,10,"To protect him, he was sent from the home of the stately worker, Prokopiya Nosova, and for the vacation of the carters and for pi"
584,0,"San_Nakladnyh, put the clerk Gazrіl Vladimirovich."
584,1,"Ilestova.During snow removal, the transportation was slow, and our riots or a pile of measles at the Vyatka station increased."
584,2,"In autumn, rain began to fall."
584,3,"You don’t give tarpaulin to the leased areas, because they are obliged to close the goods on the way, and on the place of arrival, until the goods are surrendered to the addressee, no matter what the valuable or low-value goods are, they must close the rain, until it has been handed over to the addressee, and after unloading at the leased land, it is believed that the goods have already been transferred as intended, i.e."
584,4,"surrender, and the liability of the railway has ceased."
584,5,"Every Saturday morning, I drove out to Almezha to be covered, i.e."
584,6,"I drove a pretty small amount of money, for on Saturday all the renters will hand over the bark and expect money already."
584,7,Mon Monday.
584,8,"I went back to mine again, but sometimes I lived on Almezh for 10 days each, when things were starting up at the beginning and often needed extra money."
584,9,Then for the first time I wanted to see for myself and myself the immediate decision or other changes to the order.
584,10,"When measles began to accumulate near the station, being afraid of the possibility of incomes, I began to ask more often through the station manager the Perm railway management, there are more tarpaulin roads, and in the future we will move more devices to the Almekh station of the covered warehouse, total load / load up to 50,000 annually."
584,11,"At the station Al Mezh, you sent a dozen or two tarps."
584,12,"With the consent of the head of the station, we covered tarp piles with tarpaulins not only at the station, but along the line, approximately, about a mile away from the imposed bark of the line."
584,13,"We are there, and put it in piles, so that fromsave transportation to the station, decided there and bring your second"
585,0,"weighs on the goat, re-weigh there and load the wagons, and the beginning didn’t negatively advise them to deliver the wagons there at the same hours of the day when there are no passing trains, because between Vyatka and Kotlas."
585,1,drive only once a day in one direction and once in the opposite direction.
585,2,"Temporarily by line we also closed the prepared piles with breech tarpaulins, and thus managed to send several wagons, i.e."
585,3,vygadavі did not transport a mile or two to the station.
585,4,In one of the trains passes from Perm to.
585,5,"Coterie controller yellow, dor."
585,6,"The head of the station knew about his progress, but he overlooked that tarps should not be placed at our disposal."
585,7,"The controllers, having moved to the station, see that a large pile of bark is covered by breech tarps."
585,8,"They strictly asked the leader: why the bark is covered with tarpaulins, has it already been accepted by the station, and why it is not sent."
585,9,"The head of the station did not hesitate, dismissed: “Yes, the goods must be accepted and closed until arrival for the indicated wagons”."
585,10,"But for some reason, the nodal station slowly served the wagons and there were fewer things to follow."
585,11,"”The inspector asks:“ And through the line a mile or two from here, I saw several breasts from the window covered with tarps."
585,12,Do you accept and close your linings with your own tarpaulins on the liner.
585,13,"""8."
585,14,"/ d, the head of the Almezh station, see that you made a mistake, replies:"" We didn’t accept and do not ship to the lini, but they are temporarily unloaded and transported thereafter stations temporarily behind with their tarps, but yesterday they didn’t have enough of their own."
585,15,"Today they’ll bring extra ones from the house - I’ve decided to take one or two tarpaulins for one day, for which I apologize and now demand the return of the tarpaulin tarps."
585,16,"""Call me."
585,17,I stood nearby and heard all their conversation .. Head
586,0,"the station asks: “You promised two tarpaulins to return to me all over the evening, where are they.” I say: “Now eat by train."
586,1,Will you wash yours and be replaced by yours in half an hour and be gratefully delivered to you here at the station”.
586,2,"The controller was satisfied, but told the chief that for the first time they should leave it without consequences, but recommend not to alter the interests of the railway."
586,3,I had to collect all the tarpaulins and return them to the head of the station.
586,4,In the first year.
586,5,on Almezh we collected the measles of a total of fifteen thousand.At the end of the first year Stepan Fedorovich ran through the railway.

586,12,"“Come to the heaps., To see the bottom of our clerk, Gavril 11estov.” Mr. Pan F. asks Pestov: ""Which pile is in the name of Korye."""
586,13,And G.Pestovі shows that all these sites are ours and all of our bark.
586,14,"Stepan f. Turns to Ivan at the point and say: * Personally, I was opposed to buying such korya and I would not have bought such a large pood."
586,15,It is possible to compare it with the local Bodsky or Kotelnichesky layer.
586,16,"”Ivan T. unscrewed:“ But I would, on the other hand, have bought both this and Kotelnichesky for pleasure."
586,17,It will be no worse than a boiler room.
586,18,"If it is larger, but it has thicker juice, and Kotelnich and local bark is thin, but it decreases year by year, and if you do not look for a new region of korya, then the local uncle has reached a price of 90 kopecks."
586,19,", and then to reach one and a half rubles."
586,20,"And Vam, go, it’s not more than fifty dollars."
586,21,"Do not you want, sell, I am now."
587,0,Vam at 60 kopecks.

587,2,”Stepan p. hesitated and said:“ I don’t know yet how much it will cost.
587,3,"Peter Al, everything is there, ru lead."
587,4,"Well, if it costs a fifty dollars, I think that it’s not much cheaper to come Kotelnichesky."
587,5,"”Ivan Tim, they said:“ You think in vain that is empty talk."
587,6,"In any case, well done is the one who does this, and I am glad for Vasya that you are far-sighted of my guys."
587,7,"Look, my guys couldn’t see beyond their nose, they couldn’t provide for, sit down, and at least buy a thousand pounds for a test."
587,8,"Only I can leave my tarpaulins from Moscow and close it: autumn is coming - spoil the good stuff, and after scans, the measles has been bought up bad."
587,9,"”Stepan F. Skazal:“ Yes, it seems Pavel F. has already been sent from Moscow to be taken by boat , but apparently, because of the shallow water they were stuck somewhere on the road."
587,10,"""All this talk about them the next day was conveyed by Gavril Pestovi and Prokopiya Nosov."
587,11,"Concerning the tarpaulin, indeed, when the measles began to stick in Vyatka, I telegraphed Pavel Fed."

588,0,"that I myself went to the place, everything that I could do with myself, organized, studied the matter and raised my personal observations I carried through to the end, and it turned out to be a brilliant result."
588,1,"They were expressed as follows: “If it were, for the first time, it was worth one and a half times more expensive, but it’s important that you yourself have failed, you already see for yourself, and you know very well; what could be done for the benefit, then everything was done and you’ve not missed, but you also already know if you need to increase or decrease the price from the side - you can see it, to someone else, a new person who has missed the same thing.

588,2,"I informed Pavel F. and Stepan A. that we owe a lot to the correct setting of our senior employee, Anton Anisimovich Nosov, and that from the account of Korya I should be able to send him a good gift from the company, at least a winning state ticket for the first loan."
588,3,"Did everyone approve of this proposal, bought a ticket the next day at the Vyatka branch of the Volga-Kamskago Bank and donated it to Anton Anisimovich Nosov."

588,6,"In the second year, they already before our authority, secured the consent of sirders, twice as much, because in the first year, all the peasants, returning home from the sir, immediately brought money with them, which had never happened before."

592,2,"That very day I returned to Vyatka and found out that the phlegant and Sidor had bypassed all the breeders, offered the measles."
592,3,"Finally, they sold Naihail Dmitrievich Laptev at 50 kopecks."
592,4,"for good reason, but eat it so that all the measles in the yard of the Lakhtevsk plant plant drank, because it was stripped off of them that were not finished and started to take off, so that when transferring it turned out to be a big grin."
592,5,"Instead, you have to do it, BET_lo just have six hundred, at the same time both the contributor and the Sea Dora got a big loss).Returning to the Almeyat, they not only didn’t have ours, but they didn’t accept from their own brought artels."
592,6,"Through week I am prichal; they come to my opinion and ask to buy from them everything that is recruited, as well as to accept and leave their sirschiki along with ours."
592,7,"I said: ""You started to take it very early, did not let measles dry, there will be a big shrink."

592,10,Our competitors have developed and left.
592,11,"Looking at it, in Vyatka, the whole factory had an impression that the measles were not bought in Almen and the result was an enormous squeeze, and therefore no one got excited about going to buy measles along the Kotlas line and they wondered why we were buying there We’re interested in this, and no one really needs MA to go on their ownplace and take a look."

593,7,"it’s expensive, and therefore it was cheaper for them to take lakes for revenge, and in winter, on the first path, the peasants, freed from their work, didn’t expensively carry the bark to us on the sleigh, thus, the result was no worse than the measles of Mikhail and Ivan Leontyevich Agalakovs and no more than collected at stations and with less hassle and without E the cost of personal money, during the summer."
593,8,"For we paid them in si - mine, by the time of the export of measles."

594,7,"Feed Chernyshykha with attendance, but it’s necessary to say this evening whether you will have to sit around with her and take her away, or wherever you will be on a visit."
594,8,For rounds and ukhin she will charge separately 50 kopecks.

658,4,That was how slave access to our backwater turned out to be from the postal tract.
658,5,We arranged a solid gate for driving through the highway and next to the gate for pedestrians.
658,6,"Through this entire plowing belt, a wide ditch k ѣ ѣchkѣ Mochovitsѣ passed through the tract to drain the spring and rain water tract."
658,7,"I had to fundamentally equip this ditch: to take the walls along the entire length of the column into columns, and to make wide sidewalks from one section from the top to the entire width of the ditch, i.e."
658,8,thick humped planks ѣ 2 1/2 - 3 apex of thickness with humps down.

659,4,"Ivanov, an apartment suitable for us and Parfenovich did not get drunk."
659,5,Since with secondary services A.P.
659,6,"Ivanov’s property became permanent with the Fedorovichi, and those arriving at Parfeno’s community, they also agreed to give him room for an apartment together with Fedorovichi and Parfenovichi."
659,7,"For him, an apartment on the frontier, the upper floor of the house of Ivan Prokopyevich Rusanov was rented for a year, but had to put up with inconvenience."

660,6,"In this tank, water was pumped by pumps from the well with a horse-drawn drive."
660,7,"It was also arranged for all the other Vakhrushevsky factories: the water for the tanning industry was pumped up, with the help of horse drives, Ilya Timofeevich Vakhrushev."
660,8,"He was supplied with a steam engine, which served the pumping of water, the washing of cindery leathers in ba rabanakh, and topchakakh and the crust-root."
660,9,"It was not difficult to pump water using a horse-drawn drive, while production at the plant was not very large, up to 25,000 skin per year."
660,10,"And the descendants, having taken away the price of production, began to pump water harder and harder, because for tanning production the abundance of water is of great importance and it is consumed daily by tens of thousands of buckets."
660,11,"The strongest horse is at 4 in the morning and walk around until 8 in the evening, rotating horse-drawn drives for pumping water, and sometimes even two horses."
660,12,"I wrote to Pavel Fedorovich in Moscow - is it possible to find a small locomobile with 2-3 horsepower, not expensive, especially for pumping water, assuming that such a locomobile does not require much care for him."
660,13,and it’s not necessary for him to keep a special driver and a chegar.
660,14,For it was known to us that Alexander Dem was on the demyanka for malt production.
660,15,Likhachev was a small loco mobile of 10 strength and the Likhachevs themselves managed to work on it.
660,16,"without any mechanics.Pavel Fedorovich, having received my letter, went in two"

661,6,Pavel Fedorovich bought it all and sent it through the shipping company Bulychev to Vyatka.
661,7,"At the same time, having not yet heard about buying a locomotive in Moscow, I heard at home that at Demyank, Aleksandrov's distillery, they were selling cheap two old steam engines."
661,8,I had a chance to watch.

661,10,The cars were in a bar sorted form.

661,12,"I don’t understand anything in machines, I ask mechanic Ivan Nikolayevich Poludnitsyn: “Why are these machines thrown away and sold, They haven’t been working together for years.” He explained: “For our business, fast running machines for working on electric motors are required, and this low-speed machines for working on the transmission and directly to the machines."
661,13,"They are perfectly operational and will continue to work a hundred, especially as if yours is seemingly."

822,6,"In the case of the American “all”, it all fell away, and similar weights were only in our water supply, and therefore at all times, if necessary, to transport bark or to transport goods from the factory, the carriers from the neighboring villages always went to our country, gim to the breeders."

878,4,"But I will say below about his services and the results of his work.At the same time, at the shoe factory, we, at the initiative of Pavel Fedorovich, decided to simultaneously engage in the production of felt boots from wool at our tannery, assuming that wool is part of the skin of our factory to go to felt boots when we produce felt boots and, of course, move to a chip more expensive, than we sell it at the Nizhny Novgorod fair to the breeders of Kineshamsk uzda, working boots.."
878,5,"The second reason we had was that in Siberia, voyagers would be unleashed with samples, if they would sell leather shoes and felt boots for the same expenses, then there would be direct benefit from wearing them."

880,2,We ourselves didn’t understand anything in this respect: what varieties of wool are required and what percentage is needed for the boots to be good and their cost would be no more expensive than competitors: they fully hoped and relied on craftsmanship.
880,3,"And the masters, wanting to prove that they can make good boots, put a large percentage of expensive wool of the highest quality."
880,4,"Valenoks appeared to be decent in our opinion, but it cannot be said that first-class, or worse, other factories are edging, but they are much more expensive than their cost to us - they were worth more than price-list selling prices."

921,18,"My sorting is not final, I warned your clerk that in the end I’ll once again reject the rejection and leave only what the agent should leave."
921,19,"But to keep you calm, it’s"

923,1,"We bought buckets two crayfish, cooked them and put them on a picnic, had plates and napkins, washed down with beer .."
923,2,But I got a little incident when I cooked.
923,3,"Old Tatar woman, mat: Husaina A. Tyumeneva, having seen the crayfish, she knew that it was unclean: she began to grab pots, scream that she would fuck up everything and not let her into the kitchen."
923,4,Husain Abdulovich’s wife persuaded her by force.
923,5,"She said that ""Khurayin did not order to refuse anything, allorder to provide them with orders, and we will throw away the pots in which you will cook the Crayfish, and we will give it back to them, and they will buy us a new one."
923,6,”Husain was not at that time returning from the Kuendinsky fair.
923,7,"When he arrived, he they said once — they chuckled for 11, ordered the pan to be cleaned with sand and taken to the attic for a while, brought a new one, brought it and showed the old woman, saying that she bought a new Vakhrushevха."
923,8,The old woman was very pleased.
923,9,"But in the kitchen, when cooking, I was the windows to the courtyard are open, and the doors to the rest of the room are blankly closed, if it were Duh who didn’t get into the rooms, but ельhel into the street."
923,10,"And ІІОтом, when they didn’t get the boiled crayfish from the kitchen, the old woman read Tatar prayers for a long time, apparently - she would consecrate the Tatar kitchen."
923,11,"Husain’s son Abd., Valiy Khusainovich, send me an apartment, I didn’t throw all the remains from the crayfish into the garbage pit, but tied the paper, and threw it into the ravine at night and threw it into the ravine."
923,12,"Then I explained Husa yin Abdulovich, that according to Tatar laws or laws, rivers are considered the biggest evil So kak they ѣdyat drowned nicknames."

924,1,"Of course, if I were at home, I would cook you a crayfish near neighbors in a Russian house and bring it to your apartment so that no one could see it, and also take out the trash."
924,2,But in general everything turned out well..
924,3,"In August of the month of 1906, our fifth daughter, Xenia, was born to us.In September, I s. Apollinarica Alekseevna were in Petersburg, simultaneously with Paul."
924,4,"Fedorovich, on the occasion of the bargain."
924,5,I with Nenoy for a day on Saturday left in Eronstadt.

924,7,At this time we stopped to lodge in the house Tru Truby.
924,8,"But it turned out that you are Sunday, although you served in St. Andrew’s Cathedral and father John, but there was no general confession, and priests confessed it, and it was prince."
924,9,"On Saturday evenings, after Vespers, we were left to stand and read the rules."
924,10,"The priests went out and asked: “Who is Vasya who can, according to Slavic rule, melt away."
924,11,"And at that time I will be confessing.” Apparently, nobody wants to be silent."
924,12,Apollinarіya Alekѣ.

924,14,"If there is nobody, then I will try, read, as much as I can."""
924,15,"The priest said: ""From the person, quickly and no need, we have nowhere to hurry."""
924,16,They showed her what to read.
924,17,"She read for more than an hour, all the confessors prayed, and two priests confessed at that time."
924,18,"In the morning after the reni before the Liturgy, the rule was read again, some man, and we prayed."
924,19,"For the liturgy, I myself entered the altar, and asked blessings from the father of John."
924,20,But among the servant
925,0,"came one of the okruhs: Ivan Pyotrov, a priest of dark faces, asked me to leave the altar, stating that it was impossible to stand without permission."
925,1,"Having gone onto the pulpit, where my wife was standing, I explained to him that I, with the blessings of the priest, stood BE altar, but he unscrewed: ""Anyway, stay here,"" and went away."
925,2,"II stand on the pulpit for about 10 minutes, I see that the other one to go to stand at the altar, - and I went there again."
925,3,I feel sorry for myself.
925,4,"father Ioann, but although the church was almost half full, and the Communion of OBE was not very much; they explained to Namt that when there is no general confession, whether they receive communion, and then only those who are in a hurry to leave home from Kronstadt just to receive communion from the father of Father John."
925,5,"And whoever has free time, sometimes 2-3 weeks remain and live, waiting for a general confession."
925,6,But in general it’s a rare case.
925,7,It seems that not every week there is a general confession.
925,8,"""This time you accidentally accidentally hit that today is a common confession."""
925,9,But we were no longer able to stay until next Sunday.
925,10,"This time, too, they received pleasant singing satisfaction from communion with Father John of Kronstadt - Scago."
925,11,"But nevertheless, comparatively, for the first time, with a general confession, we personally had an impression of loneliness and emotional satisfaction remained stronger.After bidding."

932,9,"It is clear to everyone that the reason for the stagnation has given - selfish question; customers — the majority of the young people — are afraid to incur troubles - too cautious, and even perhaps exaggeratedly cautious about the business, and generally, the business suffers from this and can ruin the entire industry of suppliers."
932,10,.
932,11,But something we must do.
932,12,I ask the members to express themselves *.
932,13,"The members of the Technical Committee began to cautiously say that until the senatorial audit is over, while the sword hangs over our heads, no matter what we do, we don’t help, and sooner we won’t go, forcing the borrowers to take more responsibility we have no right."
932,14,"But partly, perhaps, the breeders are also to blame, at least for the fact that almost all of the Quartermanship commissions receive information that the rejection is intensified, mainly because of insufficient tanning."
932,15,The analysis of duplication almost at all gives the minimum percentage of admissibility.
932,16,I ask for the words and declare that I will deliver ten years to Intensoft and hard shoe goods are one and the same
934,0,"This skin cannot be released, and for this, apart from tanning drums, it is recommended to have rinsing bars and presses at the factory to remove extracts from the skin after tanning before being scraped."
934,1,"But I repeat that in the interest of improving the quality of the soldier’s boots, the introduction of extra tanned coats is desirable, but this would increase the cost of shoes and not much children for small breeders who have machine equipment."
934,2,"Therefore, I express my thoughts: extract tanning of koya for Quartermaster is permissible and desirable, but notit’s necessary, but partially so far, who can do it, even with extracts."
934,3,"”The technical committee approximately and make such a decision regarding tanning, edit it in your own way."
934,4,"To speed up the reception, we decided to prescribe an acceptance fee for all acceptance commissions - to speed up the reception and In every doubtful case, send yourself inquiries and protests to the Technical Committee of the Main Competition in order to have the official right to rely on the Technical Committee for the questioning of doubtful things."

939,1,"But a big inconvenience for breeders is that there are too many potential commissions open in all of Russia, and in the remote outskirts of Russia, these breeders were weighed down and managed to deliver to: every warehouse in time."

939,3,"While dozens of years have never come from Warsaw, you haven’t a single breeder supplied the Commissariat with soft goods, and therefore the same Vyatskie or Azanskaya breeders must also bring goods to Warsaw."

940,11,"Yesterday you stated on the accountWarsaw warehouse - this completely coincided with the number of our visitation commissions, but apparently, you yesterday doubted the presence of other breeders who spoke only in general terms, without negotiating; apparently you didn’t finish something either."
940,12,"I ask Vasya, without hesitating, say everything, and if you have a name, you should speak frankly."
940,13,"All this will be between us, like a private conversation and I give you my word for myself and for General Senator Garin himself, that you personally will not be held responsible for not reporting."
940,14,"""I said:"" That we all announced yesterday together, I confirm all this and will confirm it privately and officially, add moreI can’t say anything and I don’t know anyone."

941,1,"Personally, I manage the factory and I am in Petersburg only official torres, which are produced by the military council with the participation of the okrug of the Intendant."
941,2,My opinion is that there are no illegal bids.

941,7,If there were illegal illegal acts.

942,1,"As for the second question - how to find out the contractors secret prices, approved by bidding for the district."
942,2,This is the first time I hear and I am surprised to hear from Vasya.
942,3,"In my opinion, the contractors even need to learn secret secrets."
942,4,"Bidding is carried out publicly, closed and in batches, kah: the first contractor seeks to secure his backwater with work for the whole year, he tries to declare the lowest prices in order to beat the prices of competitors and not to staywould be without an EQ, i.e."
942,5,Without E Supplies.
942,6,Without reckoning eatwhether my statement is lower or higher than the secret prices of E. There have been cases where the declared prices were higher than the secret ones.
942,7,"The second bidding is appointed, the contractors lower the price by half per cent or per cent."
942,8,"If after the second sale of some contractors the delivery is approved, and for some, at higher prices, the remaining quantity is refused and presented in the third auction, then it’s clear for everyone that the price of the morning came at a secret price and at the third auction this is acceptable."
942,9,"I appreciate for myself - to ask to take the remaining amount at this price, and sometimes even half a percent lower, afraid of competitors."

943,5,"I’ve hanged, I told everything in detail."
943,6,G.I.
943,7,"Koshurnikov turned to Alabuzov, saying: ""I said that the senator considered him to be, after the statement about the Warsaw warehouse, a simpleton, who was alone to say it all the time, and therefore invited one."
943,8,"But they didn’t attack so much - apparently, they didn’t do anything got""."
943,9,"It should be noted that I was then dressed in a kaftan with collections of peasant cuts, a good dark-blue cloth, wide trousers, and high blue beetroot boots."
943,10,"Accepting in chapter 11, in addition to this, my Vyatsky reprimand and not literary, but rather a semi-peasant syllable - all this, taken in revenge - it is possible that I appeared to Senator Garin, the 2nd WALL EO, a simpleton who it was irrevocable to express everything that was pounding on his heart, and indeed, it turned out to be a disappointment - they heard nothing new from me."
943,11,"But in the next time, while the revision was going on, they never called me to the investigator."
943,12,"Farther and we decided to expect that from E our applicants will succeed, because there is nowhere else to go - we reached the very top.months have passed."
943,13,"The entire warehouse warehouse didn’t accelerate, each party received a 50-80% rejection commission and always went to protest, and then it was already taken, but through protests the landlords guaranteed themselves that although they accepted an allegedly doubtful goods, but only after that, when the Technical Committee, disagreeing with their rejection, recognized the goods as acceptable."
944,0,"In the fall, new tenders and the need for the next year were announced."
944,1,"But all the contractors, for all warehouses, still had undelivered goods for the past year under current contracts.On the eve of the day of bargaining, having gathered together, they discussed the situation, almost no better than what was six months ago."
944,2,Most spoke out that they had no opportunity to take on the contract again until they had passed last year.
944,3,"The rest joined, and no one on the day of the auction appeared in the military district council, did not file a single application."
944,4,The Military District Council recorded and report to the Chief at the Quartermaster.
944,5,"On the next day, all suppliers, the breeders, came to Nice Intent, personally and collectively, that until there was no extra commission to accept the cut goods, according to last year’s contracts, we were practically deprived of the opportunity to take New Contracts, because our plants were almost empty , there’s nothing for us to cook raw skin."
944,6,"The semiannual experience showed that until a new, clearer description of the goods was developed, a quick passage would not go; not a single party for the past six months has been accepted without protest, and the protest dragging out the money and causing damage to the factory and to the detriment of the general state supply of the army.The Chief Quartermaster ordered to immediately arrange a meeting of the Technical Committee with the participation of breeders under his chairmanship, i.e."
944,7,Rise before eating.
944,8,Glavnago In tenant general lieutenant Kamin Skago.On the next day you held the building of the main Competition.
944,9,We began to revise the description of the glancing of the goods and the change and improvement of the external appearance of the boot.
944,10,Went on
945,0,this is a daily assignment for four days.
945,1,"With the approval of the Chief Quartermaster, we, the breeders of 11, invited a wall of graphic artists and all the preferences were recorded verbatim, but they were NOT distributed to all the participants and sent to the wholeDistrict Quartermaster Ulya oznakodіlenіya and leadership.Tipi boot was completely sidsoiz small, improve."
945,2,"You should develop a new type of beautiful Russian boot, suitable for the type the peasant, the young man, is used to at home, buying a bazaar, which is often not of durable leather quality, but it is beautiful in appearance."
945,3,"The commissariat, leaving all its technical requirements related to the strength of the skin, took into account only the beauty of the appearance and elegance of the pads; strictly established the selection when distributing a boot — to pick up each soldier’s legs, and not to randomly give out the first retreats, as before."
945,4,"Then, at the insistence of the breeder, it was introduced to accept goods although still white; while they are to be stored in a warehouse, they should be white, but upon delivery c) sewing in uniform workshops, obligate the last, for an additional fee, blacken the boots of E workshops with an old paint and thoroughly grease the seals with grease, and not a little let out the army as white as it was because it turned out to be established that by releasing the army beforehand, it was issued for blackening and fattening to each soldier in the hands of money."
945,5,Which made it very difficult for a soldier: where did he look to buy aniline paint and seal fat.
945,6,"Yes, and how to cook paint."
945,7,"Most don’t know, and although most kept this money at home, they sold shoes to the private market for half the price and added money to the proceeds"
946,0,"they were precious, and partly of their money, received from home, and they bathed in the bazaar private boots of a beautiful appearance, blackened and weathered, but not strong skin."
946,1,"And many soldiers, without having received from the house, received white boots, blackened their timber with guilt, and wore it."
946,2,"And the lumber made the skin, after a month the boots fell apart, and through this a public rumor was created that the Quartermaster or the priest’s quartermaster would take worthless goods for bribes, which would fall apart after a month."
946,3,I had to prove a little obscure claims of the previous descriptions.
946,4,"For example, a career: it was said: in the shank of the skin, only a carefully smoothed out skin is allowed."
946,5,"The word ""carefully-smoothed out is tensile and entailed mass arbitrary rejection."""
946,6,"It’s very difficult to smooth the door so that it doesn’t feel well, but the penetrated blackened one is easily smoothed."
946,7,I chose a white door with pink skin that isn’t any like a breeder.
946,8,"he wasn’t allowed to cut on the shin for a soldier’s voice, because it couldn’t be smoothed out in any way."
946,9,"”Having taken this whole collar undeveloped, by the strength of the head of the landing workshop, pierce one half of the collar to the ridge, to smooth out the bacon, blacken and roll the oatmeal measure, and leave the other half to a natural look ”, without smoothing."
946,10,"When sitting the committee in the main Quartermaster, when discussing the issue of thoroughly sorting, I take it out of the portfolio and fold it , showing the white side, I ask: “Do you want to go to such a gate to allow the bootleg to be thoroughly ironed?” They unanimously recognized that it was unacceptable, because it could not be ironed."
946,11,I take it so B0
947,0,"rotoki, turn and show the black half."
947,1,"“And how do you go about a similar gate, smoothed out to a black-faced ear and washed, whether or not acceptable.” Unanimously, the Technical Committee recognized the candidate as acceptable, but said: “If you had just shown the collar you wouldn’t have sent so well-ironed and nicely finished and in black look."
947,2,"”I, with all my strength, unzip all the gates on the ridge and put it on it, stating:“ Here’s Vai proof that the same one is porous: half was deliberately glorified by the woman, the second is for display."

947,4,"For early Sol Danish boots, without a subcontract, went forward and without pasting at the top of the boot."
947,5,"And they proved that in front of the bottomless row, the inside of the legs is sweaty, and the outside of the damp, with the outfit, keeps the leg, i.e."
947,6,external dampness through double skin will not reach the soldier’s body for longer.

1058,9,"It is not legally registered, the theater was not transferred to the city government and the committee members were dismissed without a choice of the City Duma, but somehow privately .."
1058,10,Prince SDGorchakov turned his attention to this.
1058,11,"When they were the mayor of Sintsov, then, at the suggestion of Prince Gorchakov, the city government would organize a new committee under the city government, raise the chairmanship."

1059,14,Fees were also made through other entities for subscribed steel.
1059,15,But I didn’t see the rest of the subscription sheets and it was not a shit how much was collected.
1059,16,"About a year later, I received from the neighboring city of Sarapul the Vyatka governorate letter 2: 40, the son of the tannery breeder Slagin, who was acquainted with me, who was also the vowel of the provincial council of Saapula, although he had different political views that were opposite to me."

1059,18,"The Vyatka governor’s decree was ordered - the administration of the BNO imposed on all four breeders from Russia 1,000 rubles each."
1059,19,"“We don’t feel sorry for anything, but it’s a shame to pay them, like a fine.” Knowing that you are in good relations with the governor, we decided to ask Vasya, as a colleague, a tannery breeder, if you could find it possible to tell the governor the true situation , as it was, and not as one-sidedly inform our governor our governor:"
1060,0,"We would rather donate these sums for the construction of the Vyat - a theater, or other charity, but not to be fined."
1060,1,"""At the same time, I will state in detail the essence of the matter, for which they were fined."
1060,2,"I went to Prince S. D. Gorchakov, showed him Smagin’s letter."

1060,4,"""I tell the prince:"" But what about donating these amounts to the theater."
1060,5,"The prince said: ""It is inconvenient to write about it and you are not advised, but on a personal visit you will remind them, or you may be allowed to send it through you."""
1060,6,I said that not the people of Sarapulza are Narods who are very proud and proud.

1060,9,Prince S.D.
1060,10,"They said to Gorchakov: “No, it’s inconvenient, we rely on their nobility: to send, it’s good, but not to send out - and don’t need it, moreover, that with our theater, things slowed down."
1060,11,The former committee considered itself to be the owner in the theater and not to want to transfer it to the city’s order for breaking down and building on this avenue of the Kamennago — to propose that the money collected be transferred to the IA E and they themselves build a stone theater.
1060,12,But the city can’t be reached now and I think this is wrong.
1060,13,"persevere then the theater will remain wooden th, and the collected donations will have to be returned to all the donors."
1060,14,"”From E Ca rapula, the breeders never transferred 4,000 rubles to the theater, and I"

1061,4,"In all likelihood, they did not send, approximately, other donors, passing."
1061,5,These amounts are for any other good or for the needs of charity.
1061,6,"Thus, the idea of ​​building the stone theater BE Vyatka died BE the embryo itself, or, so to speak, it turned out to be a stillborn child.In the spring of 1908, even before our trip, to introduce ourselves to the Sovereign as a monarchist party, at about the end of 11th or at the beginning of Api Rul, the river had not yet been opened, in Vyatka it was dirty, but it was still raised on a sleigh XE."

1085,13,There are a lot of people and it’s hard to get to church.
1085,14,"Discussing the question, howto keep the church’s capacity, the most convenient and cheap way was to destroy the corridors connecting the church with a bell tower 4 fathoms wide, break the corridor walls and build a new nirin in the church, then the width of the same corridor would be 10 fathoms, but it would be ugly , see the whole church,"
1086,0,"it turns out to square 10 soot, length and 10 sazhen width, and the numberthe stake will seem smaller than the church - to disgrace the style, and most importantly - the capacity will increase by only 600-800 people .. Having come to the church with an architect."

1086,10,"Another way is recommended: to drop the entire bell tower on its side, and when it falls and, from hitting the ground, the bricks will sprinkle one on top of the other and there will be more whole bricks that will go round again."
1086,11,"Thus, a big benefit will be obtained by preserving whose bricks, and most importantly, cleaning old bricks on the ground will give the opportunity to save a lot of time."

1109,3,"Buyers recognized it by washing and honor for skating rinks and koshma no worse than Vyatka, but only shorter, and only priced two and a half two pounds cheaper than the Vyatka ruble."
1109,4,"When we found their price to be acceptable, then all the valenchiki and koshomiki fell off buying it willingly."

1110,4,"Since we have increased the quantity of wool, we began to take care in advance of our products BUT YOUR sales market eliminates the idea that if we brought all the wool to you, you will have the Nizhny Novgorod Fair, which until now had not had any wool, but some kind of wool Koshems were satisfying, they were afraid that they wouldn’t bring down prices for all varieties of self-harm, both in St. Petersburg and in Vyatka, to compete with other areas of wool and to compete with other offers of wool."

1111,1,"After some time, all the lovers, having arrived on the market day in the city of Vyatka, themselves began to ask them to sell Petersburg wool to them for all the needs of their winter felted work, to whom 50 poods, and to whom 200 or 300 pounds."
1111,2,"I’ll take it that they will take a conditional price for a week and pay only for the taken bale or two money, and the rest of the purchased amount with a deposit so that it was kept until spring by S.A. Rukavishnikova."
1111,3,"After a week or two, the valenchik has the right to again take one or two bales or more and again pay only for this amount, and the deposit remains until the entire amount is removed."
1111,4,"S.A. Rukavishnikov, we were warned that they could sell it no matter what they demanded: ""Sell it - wire it, the wool will be sent immediately, there will be no delay in sending wool from Petersburg."""
1111,5,In this way.
1111,6,"S.A. Rukavishnikov immediately for the sale of wool several wagons and wrote to St. Petersburg to send not all of a sudden, but regularly every month for 1-2 wagons during the winter."
1111,7,The rest of the wool from St. Petersburg was sent to the Nizhny Novgorod Fair.
1111,8,"But St. Petersburg handicraftsmen, rolling cats and reselling these cats for construction to contractors and suppliers of artillery and cavalry harnesses for the army, in which the cats go on sweatshirts to the clamp and saddle, lined with leather, found out about our good washing of wool."
1111,9,"Kustari, who is such a kokhim, themselves came to us for work for usvod, bought a sample of wool and were satisfied."

1112,0,state.
1112,1,We made a calculation.
1112,2,It turned out that selling my con is much more profitable.
1112,3,"Arzamas wrote in the Nizhny Novgorod province, it turned out that you can get special workers kosho vishchikov from there, work as much as you want and at the right price, work like that, since you got a lot of weight."
1112,4,"We see that there is almost no risk at all, as well as reputable supplier firms to work consider interestNothing but artisans."
1112,5,"You made an agreement with the suppliers, you wrote to Iz Arzamas for several people, immediately built a second wooden long but narrow one-story building near the wool mill, and nightmares began to work in it - both for construction and for the army."
1112,6,"Krom Arzamassky workers, we took and local."
1112,7,* Workers from handicraftsmen.
1112,8,"Thus, we were even more prevented from selling wool, and, besides, along with one wool company, we had the second enterprise - a cat-made one, which lasted until the revolution."
1112,9,"During the revolution, N.P."
1112,10,"The Reds burned a plant of terror from the factory and hid in Arzamas, where he died."
1112,11,suddenly.
1112,12,"What happened during the revolution later with the remaining factory and machines, so far it is not known to this day.I have previously reported that in “Tiflis” is our largest consumer in the city of Adelhanov payment suspension; atAt that time he owed us a debt of up to approximately 140,000 rubles in promissory notes."
1112,13,All bills of exchange were recorded in different banks in Moscow and part of you are Vyatka.
1112,14,"We had to redeem all bills of exchange from the bank in ourselves and there was a need to somehow find out the reason for the non-payment and postpone - to take new bills or present for collection through a commercial judge, declare Adelkhanov"
1113,0, insolvent.
1113,1,"In the last case, you must personally attend Tifli and act through Tiflis attorneys."
1113,2,Pavel Fed.
1113,3,start to say that he himself.
1113,4,"Go to Tiflis not to dare and not to let his son go, he is afraid that he may hire some sort of gold and money and kill or poison all the bills and steal all of the bills, and also don’t advise to go by yourself in the dark, but it’s better to hire some good from Vyatka lawyers  and send him alone to act by proxy or, even better, together with one of our employees."
1113,5,"After a thorough discussion and advice with the bank managers of Vyatka, we decided to hire the Vyatka lawyer Pyotr Karlovich Renault and, on the other hand, sent our accountant Mikhail Petrovich Ivan Nova, giving them complete power of attorney and instructions to end the amount of peace if there was nothing to be desired."
1113,6,Soon we received a copy of Tiflis from Ivanov and Renault that Adelkhanov explained the delay in payment by unforeseen circumstances due to senatorial audit and other.
1113,7,No discounts are required.
1113,8,"Ask only to wait, take the whole amount of new bills, starting a month later, the worm will pay 5000 rubles every 10 days and you are hoped to pay everything in full and even at interest."
1113,9,"We rejected - asking for cash at least 20,000 pounds, an extreme of 10,000, the rest with promissory notes, but at the very least agree with his offer."
1113,10,Judge not to file and not to declare insolvency.
1113,11,"Well, now I don’t remember, it seems 10 or 20 thousand Adelkhan’s distance in private, the rest issued new bills, the main shareholder of G.Ғ."
1113,12,Adelkhanov and company.
1113,13,For the last time it turned out that they took someone into a company and established a joint stock company
1114,0,society.
1114,1,The promissory notes brought from Tiflis again took into account Mo ’bills and a small part of Vyatka.
1114,2,"After a month, you again began to meet the deadlines for new bills and Adelkhanov began to redeem them carefully."
1114,3,So two or three months passed.
1114,4,The joint-stock company Adelkhanov and the company again suspended payments on new Е bills.
1114,5,"Again, bills began to come back in protest."
1114,6,Namt again brought the Los bills to buy out the banks.
1114,7,"Then we began to conduct mail correspondence with Adelkhanov that ""we went to meet you, deferred and we called you, but without any explanation and offer you stopped the payments and new promissory notes, and put us in a critical position to redeem bank with protests."
1114,8,“The last one is undermined by our personal credit.
1114,9,We ask you to explain what all this is caused by and how.
1114,10,You intend to settle this matter.
1114,11,Or you leave us to stand on our own.” It turned out that Adelkhanov’s under the circumstances.
1114,12,"and unfortunate cases, for all his wishes, he could not continue to pay all bills."
1114,13,"It remains unpaid up to 80,000 rubles, which they should ask for an installment plan of three or four years."
1114,14,"If we want to end the matter immediately, then one of his friends would like to drink with us."
1114,15,all bills of 15 kopecks.
1114,16,for the ruble.
1114,17,"Otherwise, he will be forced to reconcile with the fact that we will bring a court to recovery, which will give an excuse to present to the rest of his creditors as well."
1114,18,"To be declared insolvent, everything will stop and the goods and property will go with the auction."
1114,19,"Whether it is more profitable for us, they are left to us to solve."
1114,20,We did not distract for a long time.
1114,21,"Some of us advised to spread out for 3-4 years, others advised to take 15"
1115,0, While giving.
1115,1,"Still others advised declaring them insolvent and putting them in jail (although it was stipulated that they could manage to dodge with the help of doctors - to present medical evidence, to have heart defects or something that, by law, it would be impossible to put him in jail."
1115,2,"Finally, they wrote to Adelkhanova that you’re ready to agree to a peace agreement, about 50 kopecks per ruble, and for final settlement, please pass through 14 oskva or contact us at Vyatka."
1115,3,But we don’t agree to 15 kopecks.
1115,4,"He said: “I will and I will persuade of their friends to end you with more interesting conditions for you, for all My creditors have given me my word to support me and will not be charged until you show your company as one of the largest creditors, as there is the slightest opportunity for settlement, with full I will fully send you Vyatka Vyatka Stephen Avetisovich Vartozaryants, with whom, I hope, you will achieve prosperity - the first result."
1115,5,"”In a few months,S.A."
1115,6,Vartozaryants.
1115,7,The beginning is that: “GG Adelkhanov sent me to try to persuade Vasya to finish the deal.
1115,8,"15 kopecks per ruble, because his friend, who wants to buy all the bills, can not, or does not want, more than 15 kopecks All other creditors conditionally agreed, but I’ll say that if you agree, otherwise they don’t agree without you agreeing to buy it in other parts, ultimately said: either all or nothing, but I categorically refused to go , argued to Mr. Adelkhanov that if they did not immediately agree to 15%, then how would they calculate to agree to them on the same bargain."
1116,0," As a result of a trip, you need to add something, a hundred and fifteen, offer 20%, otherwise there is no need to go - send someone else who will undertake to arrange a 15% deal."
1116,1,"Finally, g. Adele Khanov, apparently, persuade your friend to give you 20% secretly from others, the next day he said that I would definitely eat, and they said that if you could not arrange a business with the Vakhrushevs, then I would have no one else to send."
1116,2,It is necessary to provide all creditors with action on them.
1116,3,discretion.
1116,4,"We still persisted in the day, trying to stretch up to 30%, then up to 25%, but could not do anything."
1116,5,"S. A. Vartozaryants said one thing that was not in his power: ""I told you openly my conversation with the owner, but I can’t add anything more."
1116,6,"I tried your best, pulled 5%, but if you are unsatisfied then my conscience is clean before you and before the master."
1116,7,"I am not in your post II il il ""."
1116,8,"We consulted with each other and paused that if we insisted on another 5% to get the extra, it would be 4000 rubles, let him go again for six months or a year, and if later would be able to get more - this is still fortunate."
1116,9,"We decided that we are losing more, let the loss increase by another 4 thousand."
1116,10,Do not hold on to the head - there is nothing to cling to.
1116,11,"And if we end peacefully, maybe in the future."
1116,12,Adelhanov will be our buyer.
1116,13,"Have we done away with Vartozaryanzel, cabled our consent to Tiflis Adelkhanov at 20% per ruble, eat to transfer to Vyatka at Vartozaryants address 16,000 rubles."
1116,14,to transfer nai.

1117,1,"After a few days, the transfer was received and we calculated with Vartozaryants."
1117,2,"done, he went away back to Tiflis."
1117,3,"But in the future, Adelkhanov did not buy shoe products from anyone, but he didn’t buy shoe goods from the Quartermaster because he refused to build the soldier’s boots for the Tiflis okrug from his goods, and his outfit workshop undertook to build the same number of sannogs for the Tiflis military okrug, already from Kazakh treasury, getting only for work, i.e."
1117,4,from the goods procured by the Quartermaster from public tendering.
1117,5,"Trip BE Been tofied by Renault and Ivanova, except for the costs of railway tickets and their contents, the following expenses have been expressed."
1117,6,"According to the conditions, we paid a fee to the attorney Renault for the sum of 3000 rubles, as well as to give M.P."
1117,7,"Ivanov 1500 p. But just like 2 years or 3 years earlier, by us M.P."
1117,8,"Ivanov was granted a long-term interest-free loan of 5,000 rubles."
1117,9,"to build his house in Vyatka on Prison Street, then donated now."
1117,10,"We deducted 1,500 rubles in repayment of their debt of 5,000."
1117,11,"He himself proposed to reduce these 1,500 rubles, he had 3500 rubles left, and after a year or two the rest was written off in repayment for the same trip.In 1908 and 1909, private shoes were partly still used by us at the shoe factory to eliminate all the remnants of a cut-out part of an ovago yuft cut."

1118,2,“Would your host Vakhrushev take this up.
1118,3,"I would love to hear him from the Quartermaster, from whom I heard this."
1118,4,"I hope that if it turned out to be a good deal, then there’s even a small fee to get over.” Usanov said: ""Our owners have worked for the Quartermaster for dozens of years, I believe that their boots are also delivered to Irkutsk, but they are unlikely to agree to build a factory in Irkutsk."""
1118,5,"But just in case, Usansv recorded the address of this I.N."
1118,6,"Berkovich, saying: “I’ll inform the owners how they can solve it - I’ll inform you.” I’ll return to our factory, A."
1118,7,A. Usa told us his conversation with I. M. Berkovich.

1118,9,But a lot of thought came to me whether Berkovich or our Usanov was in the wrong way.
1118,10,Is it not to be for the border guard to look for Manchuria to be a supplier?
1118,11,Having discussed.
1118,12,among themselves with.

1166,1,"; when the number of workers increased, the bathhouse was already being fired for two days in a row, thus four men’s and two horse-clothes fell on a heated bathhouse."
1166,2,"Translating this into material calculations, the factory owner had to spend some amount on a weekly basis to spend on the bathhouse and spit the cost of the wood that was burned in the heating bathhouse."

1166,4,"The machine’s car, as well as the hot water for the bath, comes from the common tank, in which it is heated through the steam through the same steam."

1180,11,But I recommend Vam to him only because he would have been as unpleasant for the left Oryol vowels as I had been undesirable for them.

1181,3,"Frankly speaking, Fedor I. Platunov wanted to get to Orlov by appointment and was elected, by choice, he did not hope to be elected as his vowel and never ran."

1216,1,"This time, maybe, deliberately while visiting, I found it uncomfortable to name the whole thing and said only: a good sterlet for four, and the fisherman, apparently, wanted to curry favor with the owner, show his accuracy, also asked his grandson what weight."

A. Kriclichevsky the Quartermaster’s operations and practices with which banks are not familiar."
1219,7,"In this case, accounting for the Quarterly receipts was not familiar to the banks, since banks had never before received this transaction and thought that the unlimited Quarterly receipt or almost no official documents, or the Quarterly payment could delay payments on them ."
1219,8,"Based on this, the Volga-Kama and Siberian banks refused to accept this operation, and the Russian-foreign bank!"

1221,8,"I heard hell, in Petersburg, that you are now working on very good boots for the Russian army, and you are settling settlements with the Quartermaster through a Napkinsky Bank."
1221,9,"If you started delivery to Constantinople, then through our bank you can carry out all financial transactions and personally I can, wherever it becomes necessary, render any assistance"

1222,14,"I am convinced that I, indeed, had conversations with the director and, with all desires, didn’t immediately get wet"
1223,0," to give a definite answer, because I must first discuss this at home with my companion."
1223,1,"And my personal opinion is such that I would consider it advisable to pay attention to this proposal, 10 which went through the Russian Bank: if you had to make a deal, the bank also had a moral obligation to provide all this assistance and financial support, and if it was not suitable, it’s only at the risk of traveling 500 or 1000 rubles."
1223,2,”A.P.
1223,3,"Dolgushin said:“ At first I thought the same, but the factory owners waved my hand at Shi Vyatskiye, saying that they should take goods abroad at their own risk - and suddenly, there reject that then."

1223,5,"I joined the common many, and also refused."
1223,6,"""I said that I still think and will advise."
1223,7,"I’m sure that it’s so steadfast; if the Turkish Quartermaster turns out to be interesting and the product is pleasant, then it’s good to speak with the Russian Embassy and the Russian - an external bank can be worked out, condition the production of openings at our factory through our Intendan or Odessa, or Constantine Tinopol, through the Russian embassy or through the bank."
1223,8,"The main question is whether they want: whether they want to In general, I have to leave from Russia, since they had all the uniforms for the army delivered to Austria, and the second, also very significant question: can we compete with the valuable Austrian ones in connection with exchange rates, when translating, Turkish currency into Russian rubles and in Austria."

1224,1,"Only 2-3 weeks I can’t leave home; if you wait, then let's go: together."
1224,2,"""I said:"" I won’t get ready soon, when we will discuss something else too and you - rim, prepare samples."

1224,11,Many times
1225,0,"He expressed and was surprised that Peter, Aleksandrovich, just as he could speak, could say so, “From hell Intendanti right behind you and listen.” Now, I don’t get involved, I see it better to go out."

1226,8,"In my opinion, Vyatka breeders are in vain Yes, however, they don’t have any shoe factories, and if the Turks decide to buy them, they’ll need them to be sewn with boots."

1230,9,"We, like everyone else, chose to go to the deck."
1230,10,"There, in Daku, in the little chapties, a Turkish coffee."
1230,11,"We say to each other: “Something stingy is given to give a coffee, a cup is already very small.” Having tried 10 sip, you came to admire."
1230,12,Then only they learned the taste of Turkish coffee brewed with sugar.
1230,13,"You a cup, talkWe learn that it’s good, but not enough - whether you can ask for a cup of tea."
1230,14,"But Apollinariya Alekseyevna began to insist that no one would go to the second, “You will demand the second, keep it in mind, maybe it’s considered indecent.” And then - it’s very short, it will have a harmful effect on the heart."
1230,15,"* For the evening party, we did, though at the same time from the long table, but we didn’t already need vodka, but we drank and ate everything we had to drink and give something else."
1230,16,Our steamer was on the Black Sea.
1230,17,We spent a day.
1230,18,We didn’t see the coast.
1230,19,"The next day, coming up to the Bosphorus, m : saw the palm forest on the shore."
1230,20,"The whole audience went on deck to admire, like let's go but I’m going to meet the steamer to go a boat from Flazh village, since the steamer stopped sazhenyah at about 20 coasts, about"
1231,0, the mouth of the Bosphorus.
1231,1,"When the boat approached the steamboat, a Turkish official took up it and passed."
1231,2,"I handed the kanigun and handed it to him, and with them officials on the boat of the Irіkhal from the Russian-foreign bank also handed it to the director of the bank."
1231,3,"Minute through 10 it was all announced that the order was received from the Turkish government: do not let the ship go into the Bosphorus, you must be quarantined for five days, because in Turkey you learned from the newspaper that somewhere you were in Russia, there was a plague if passengers didn’t bring plague to Khonstantinople."
1231,4,There is nothing to do - you have to sit and wait.
1231,5,"When he saw the director of the bank, they learned from him that the bank was in Constantinople, having learned that the ship was to be built for five days in quarantine, he sent the director urgent correspondence and newspapers, from which he confirmed that, indeed, there had been more than a few Russia."
1231,6,"plague diseases, but even then it is doubtful - there was a brief note in the newspapers."
1231,7,But nothing is false.
1231,8,The government ordered no one can object .. We spent five days here.
1231,9,"The audience alternately went ashore on a boat, bathed in water, and for the third-class public, a free and necessarily hot bath was offered on the beach."
1231,10,"Everyone from the 3rd class was taken to this bath one by one, but the list, to the first-class and second-class public, was taken to the steamer daily with hot baths from fresh water and cold baths and showers from sea water."
1231,11,They also watched and warned that everyone should take baths without fail.
1231,12,"Finally, on the fifth day in the morning, Turkish officials and doctors arrived from Constantinople."
1231,13,"They sat down on the bast, and the audience I was asked to go all the way to one end of the ship, and then slowly passed by the doctor and officials in pairs"
1232,0,go to the other end of the ship.
1232,1,"The doctor looked all in the face and eyes, but no one dubious was indicated, everyone was passing by them cheerful and communicating over them - to look."
1232,2,"About first time, it’s first, second, and finally third classes, the doctors carefully examined the staff of the house."
1232,3,"Finally, they announced that everything was safe and that the steamship now entered the Bosphorus."
1232,4,We stayed with another public on deck.
1232,5,"When they entered the forest, a wonderful panorama of ma began: along both the embankments and the embankments, luxurious palaces and villas in the azat - skom style, palm and cedar howled gardens."
1232,6,We stood in the bow of the ship and admired on both sides.
1232,7,"Unbearable, but it was to tear off his gaze."
1232,8,"“1 closer we came to the city itself, while the buildings were solid and elegant."
1232,9,"Finally, from a distance we saw the grandiose former cathedral of Tsar'grad of St. Sophia, on which, along with the cross, there is a huge gilded Mohammedan sky half-moon."
1232,10,"When we approached the wharf, it turned out that the bank directors had come to meet the wife and the bank's artisan and the Russian translator, specially designed for us; We were recommended and passed on to us."
1232,11,"In order for him to arrange for us to have baggage at customs, with passports, the whole hotel would be in our hotel - the best is Tokatli An on Nera Street, and all the time it would be at our disposal."
1232,12,Luggage.
1232,13,"and the translator arranged everything quickly with passports, they didn’t even open a single suitcase with us."
1232,14,"We liked it, we smiled and said that the devil wasn’t as frightened as he was painted, everyone was afraid that customs were very strict about luggage, and they didn’t even inspect anything about how much honor we had, we decided that Russian is in good standing, k."

1234,8,"translator, serving with the Russian mission."
1234,9,"Upon learning that they had arrived, he came to offer his services."
1234,10,"We rejected that we already have a translator, thanked him, but refused his service."
1234,11,After half an hour we rush or stoke a seagull.
1234,12,Tea and sugar were taken away.
1234,13,"An electric bell rang a footman, forcing them to serve tea devices and boiling water."
1234,14,"He doesn’t understand us, we don’t understand him."
1234,15,"Duchey Gone, sent another; and they didn’t agree with this."

1234,18,"Rejoiced, confirmed: ""Yes, warm water, but hotter."""
1234,19,"""She told us to bring slightly tepid water into the teapot, from which tea would not be brewed, and did not bring tea devices."

1234,24,"He said: “And I want tea, but we’re hardly fighting."
1234,25,"We’ll go to the coffee house, maybe we can find some tea, today I’ll have some coffee today, and tomorrow we’ll order it by transferring the tea to 4 o’clock, so that we can serve tea daily. """
1234,26,"So on this day, we left without a trace of fear."
1234,27,The church “was marched with the help of a cabman.
1234,28,"We stood all night, returned to the hotel, went to the same hotel restaurant to have dinner."

1235,3,We have shown that we need a table.
1235,4,"They found a free table, sat us, and gave us a card in French француз."
1235,5,We looked - we can’t read.
1235,6,"We say to him: * Sitting at your place, we saw a footman, speaking Russian in Russian, could we put him for us ""He understands with his shoulders:"" Do not compromise pa. ""I clicked his palm on his forehead, quickly saying on the go:"" Ponele, understand, ""and I hid another room  a buffet”."
1235,7,"We think that he understood, now bring the army of Nina, speaking Russian."
1235,8,"But at that time we ourselves sawthe lackey of the Armenian, they called him to his table and grew up to serve us and ordered him a favor."
1235,9,"Armen inlakey opel pass the order to the bartender, and at that time again."
1235,10,running up to our table met d?
1235,11,the hotels are in the hands of a pikalik with the red head of Russian vodka.
1235,12,"Ciayuschіy, pleased shows us and says: ""ІПонене, I am rushing vodka."""
1235,13,"We laughed, we say: “Well, pony me, okay, come on here, put on the mat."
1235,14,"We took the cabinet from his hand, put it on the table, we ourselves laugh, we can’t resist."
1235,15,"He was embarrassed, he wants to take the vodka back, we told him we show facial expressions - leave, we all laugh rather loudly, we can’t fight."
1235,16,"From the next table we look at us, then, after five people saw us, we’re sitting our acquaintance, the bank director."
1235,17,"And he saw us, come up to us!"
1235,18,"and asks: ""What happened to you, all return or attention to you."
1235,19,"“We told him that we asked to give us a footman, speaking the Russian language, and he said: Ponemé, Ponemé, and fucking up the vodka scale."
1235,20,"* The director also laughed,"
1236,0,explained to this meter d hotel.
1236,1,"At this time, the footman of the army brought us a serving."
1236,2,"The director of the bank went to his desk, told his company, and at the next table everyone was laughing no less than ours."
1236,3,So it is with us.
1236,4,the first day the law was fun.
1236,5,"And in the morning, through the same Armenian lackey, we ordered the barman to be served in the morning tea, but the tea pots and boiling water for tea were the hottest."
1236,6,"This time everything turned out to be understood correctly, and in the morning, at the indicated time, everything was neatly executed.The next day, for the feast, we went to the hospital’s Orthodox Church for the liturgy, and after breakfast with a translation we went to inspect the mosque - formerly, the enormous right of the glorious St. Sophia Cathedral."
1236,7,"At the entrance to this cathedral, our attention was drawn to the fact that after the new iron doors, you should wipe the old oak doors open, you should open the hinges, and the corners of the doors - the doors have already entered, and therefore the doors do not close and in no case can they be shut off without repair."
1236,8,"But according to Turkish tradition, explain that no repairs can be made, because the Turks have a legend, as if some saint had predicted that the Turks would own Tsargrad to their port, while they would be safe and safe to use the best mosque / those."
1236,9,the former Cathedral of St. Sophia and /.
1236,10,"If only they destroy or substantially change this shrine, then God will be banished to the Turks, the Orthodox will come and drive them out of Constantinople, and on St. Sophia again litters the Orthodox cross instead of the Mohammedan crescent."
1236,11,"In connection with this legend, we were once told the second legend."
1236,12,When
1237,0,"During the war, the glorious Turks took Constantinople, then a few hundred people of 11 Orthodox entered the choirs and locked themselves in a large stone pantry."
1237,1,"The winners of the Turks suggested that they give up and leave, but the lost categorically refused."
1237,2,"Then, the main boss of the winners was ordered to block the entrance with a cement wall and no one had looked there since then."
1237,3,"According to the same legend, if you look at this muddied wall, then dominion over Tsargradov and the Turks will end: 0."
1237,4,"Upon entering the mosque, it was all our intention to take off our boots and put on those russky soft shoes or put on those of our sagos, Without their shoes no one was allowed to step on the floor of their mosque."
1237,5,"tati all obeyed, put on top of their Emblet to their sandals."
1237,6,"When we entered the former Cathedral of St. Sophia, we were struck by the grandeur, the vastness of the building and the beauty of the device."
1237,7,We were surprised that thousands of famous architects were already then before our days.
1237,8,"To tears, it was a pity and a shame that such an Orthodox shrine turned into a Mohammedan mosque and is in the hands of the Turks."
1237,9,"Throughout the mosque, hundreds of small chandeliers of black color, or cast-iron, or dark bronze were hung up once."
1237,10,"In the mosque, the audience is led by their mullah and once - different legends and descriptions of the mosque tell, and our translator translates us."
1237,11,"Someone else was shown on columnsѣ, fathoms and tori from the floor, as if a fingerprint with fingers."
1237,12,"This explains to him that when the Turks took the winners of Constantinople, then the governor, the commander of the Turkish fought Orthodox on horseback."
1237,13,"They were of enormous growth, a hero and of enormous strength, they demanded that they bring to him the restless Orthodox in the choirҳѣ, but when he should see5; or, that they refused to go out, then the commander, getting excited, hit his palm on"
1238,0,"columns, saying: ""Let them remain there forever, as long as this building exists."""
1238,1,"He ordered that you go out to quarrel with the polecat, Striking the stone column was so strong that under the palm of your hand the stone pressed in and left to follow the palms and the forearm fell."
1238,2,"How much all this is false, and whether there is any kind of material evidence of this, have not been explained to us."
1238,3,"Zatm vu kuIIol and partly in order to pass through the paintwork of the faces of the old images of the Orthodox saints ’icons, but they periodically paint the Turks with solid dark green paint."
1238,4,"Then we examined several more mosques, which, after Sophia, did not completely stop at our attention.On one of the following days, the translator was lucky to show us the prayer house of the dervishes."
1238,5,"Here we were again surprised and it was time for the wife to be self-sacrificing and fanaticism, the religiousness of the Turks der Viche."
1238,6,"When we saw a prayer house or a dervishes mosque, we saw a huge room covered with carpets."
1238,7,"Sitting on the floor for a long shawl - a hoodie, in headdresses, the Turks of the old mullahs, and around them and throughout the large area, while the same large white shrouds, there are a dozen little circles around the head, circling as many with arms outstretched to the side, with one palm facing up, as if for giving, and the other down, with the floor, and the same for all."
1238,8,Everyone is open and his eyes are fixed on the ceiling.
1238,9,"Among the vertigents of the Yashischi, there are old people; stand up on the floor and sitting mullahs and join the vertically alternating but, but most of all among the revolving, as it seemed to us young, - 20 to 40 years old, and among the last, i.e."
1238,10,"young dey, as if there is competition - sport: who share"
1239,0,will be checked.
1239,1,Old people for 5-10 minutes.
1239,2,"they will turn around and sit down again, read prayers to themselves, and vert whisper something to whisper for some half an hour, three quarters of an hour and an hour or more or less, if you eat them with your knees, hit your face and fall, but they don’t take your hands away from their established position , Do not wipe sweat, but continue."
1239,3,to spin.
1239,4,"We sat among the audience on a bench by the side, our heads turned to look at their spins, and they all turn and turn, but without any system: alone, tired, or sit on the floor, but lift yourself, or leave."
1239,5,"Having a rest, having a little rest, get up again and turn around, and many come back in and join the revolving ones."
1239,6,"As if there are cases that sometimes turn around before losing consciousness, i.e."
1239,7,"before that, unconsciousness dies and faints."
1239,8,"To take him out to the courtyard, to the air, to bring him the feeling that he would either go to the prayer again, continue to pray, or take him home."
1239,9,"When we fainted, not a single one fell, but 2-3 young men, for 22-25 years, turned for more than an hour."
1239,10,"We all looked at them and expected what would end, but we didn’t have enough patience, and not waiting for the end, we left."
1239,11,"In the evening, we drove a translator into a public garden."
1239,12,"In the middle of the garden was a wooden theater and since that time there was a Russian singer Orlova, gave a concert, sang in Russian and in French."
1239,13,"We zealously applauded her, especially when she sang in Russian."
1239,14,"The people were almost full, but the music and song was generally lower than average, but apparently the Turks liked to applaud strongly."
1239,15,In the garden there was an open paid skating.-ringѣ.
1239,16,Our translator failed us all there and advised to rent skates for roller skates for the boy.
1240,0, Borya.
1240,1,from.
1240,2,"Pleasure took, and ride."
1240,3,The next day we again came into the garden.
1240,4,Borya asked to skate again.
1240,5,I gave him money.
1240,6,and let him go to the skating ring.
1240,7,"one, they themselves remained in a buffet in front of an open stage to drink a Turkish coffee."
1240,8,But after 10-15 minutes we went to see how ours is.
1240,9,Borya is riding.
1240,10,"Come m. To the door of the skating ring, vi dim - inside our boy we should stand near the ticket office and cry."
1240,11,"Through the translator we learned that he was let into the inner courtyard of the skating ring and took only admission and did not allow skates, there was nothing for him to ride."
1240,12,Explain not to be able to.
1240,13,"We paid for the rent of skates, put it on his feet."
1240,14,"He immediately stopped crying, went for a drive and chuckled."
1240,15,A.P.
1240,16,Dolgushin.
1240,17,"they began to scoff at him and scoff that such a big boy arrived abroad and cried.On weekdays, we, at the expense of the Russian consulate, finally achieved admission to the military, apparently from our Quartermaster."
1240,18,"He took us some kind of ours, i.e."
1240,19,"the Turkish general, who examined us and the samples, praised and admired him, asked him to leave the report to the higher authorities, suggested he come back again after a few days."
1240,20,"We went in a second time, then the third, the fourth time — we didn’t say anything definite — either the council had not yet taken place, or the Minister of War was taking part."
1240,21,"So we couldn’t understand whether they first wanted to receive gifts that seemed to be practiced, or simply they are already bound by Austrian contracts and suppliers."
1240,22,"We left samples upon application, asked us to send them through the Russian consulate."
1240,23,"Between the guests, in the evenings, we visited the Russian secretary of consulates 2-3 times in the evening"
1241,0,state.
1241,1,"He would marry a Russian, and his wife accompanied Apollina to Rіyu Alekseevna s. Borey shopping in Constantinople, while I'm with."
1241,2,Dolgunin and the translator served in the Turkish Quartermaster.
1241,3,"Sometimes we also went shopping with ladies, buy or various Turkish lace, napkins, Turkish fesci, and various unnecessary things for gifts in memory of the stay of Constantinople."
1241,4,At the request of Jacob Nick.
1241,5,"Khudozhilova, I bought a present for him, he has various obscene photographic cards ”, which, it turns out, Constantinople is famous for and abounds, bought and A.P."
1241,6,Dolgushin.
1241,7,"Then, on the other hand, artificial clean work, a large amethyst of rubles for 75 and orderthe same amethyst-gold ring."
1241,8,"I was surprised - why did he ask: ""What, it’s impossible to buy such things from us in St."
1241,9,"Petersburg."""
1241,10,A.I.
1241,11,"Dolgushin turned away, which was very cleanly done, to marry the real one, but a real size of this size costs more than a thousand rubles."
1241,12,"""I’ll say that in Turkey I bought for 800 rubles and everybody believed it."
1241,13,* I said that I wouldn’t buy it if I don’t understand it.
1241,14,"If I buy, I would prefer a diamond, or pressa little bit.We lived in Constantinople for a week, without achieving any result, but we examined the entire city, and made a bad impression on us."
1241,15,"The houses are more and more wooden, with ties of 2-4 fenders and 4–5 floors, so much of the house is to stand out from one apartment, 1 or 2 rooms in each floor."
1241,16,"Steep wooden stairs inside, you climb up like a hut."
1241,17,B.
1241,18,"A similar apartment, we visited the secretary of the consulate."
1241,19,"The best street is Pera, where the Tokatlian hotel is located where we stayed for a week."
1241,20,This street
1242,0,"wider than others, but even then, already in European cities."
1242,1,"Nevertheless, there are many stone and big houses on this street, and most of the streets are so narrow and crooked that it would be difficult to spread out on two carriages that came in contact."
1242,2,"They all said that there was a fire, so the whole city would immediately burn like fire ."
1242,3,"Indeed, one evening, if you hear the noise in the streets, you should hear the sound of horns, sirens."
1242,4,"We went out of the hotel to the street, we looked — along the street, run around, all the way and several people pull on a stick, 4 people on each shoulder, a little fire truck, drag another, stick on a stick, barrel with water or buckets, hooks and more."
1242,5,"So hundreds of people flashed, all with a fireman and tools."
1242,6,Later they explained to us that this was a fire squad and they always kept on dragging everything to the place with 110 heat and immediately filled the cook.
1242,7,"Horses are not suitable for firefighting, and even with such narrow streets, streets would be blocked more often - neither pass nor pass.Once upon a time: They advised me to take a small passenger boat along the Bosphorus, still enjoy the buildings, get to the Russian embassy's dacha, take a walk there in the garden."
1242,8,We have gone.
1242,9,It turned out - a huge name of the Russian embassy; out of town.

1242,11,"We went for a walk, inspect the garden."
1242,12,"Namkh came upon the nanny of the envoy - walking in the garden with someone's child, and the child has a huge cedar cone with orks in his hand."

1243,3,"She denied that there was still much for him at home.On Friday, our translator was lucky to drive to the Sultan’s palace, like a ceremonial sultan  to take your palace mosque from the palace to pray."
1243,4,"It turned out to be very interesting, and worth a look."
1243,5,"All 110, they went with an interpreter an hour before the departure of the Sultan."
1243,6,The translator entered the courtyard.

1244,1,"But since moving the Ot of the palace to the mosque is close, no one fell behind and fell."
1244,2,"During the passage of the Sultan, all the troops took guard, and the music played."

1247,3,"Whatever initiative I took, whatever I proposed, he agreed with me in everything and did not hinder anything, but on the contrary, he tried to develop and expand the idea that I had conceived But he again had his passion — he liked to build, increase backwater, and all so that it was solid and beautiful in his appearance."
1247,4,"Having organized a shoe factory, he did not like that the glue factory was blocking the factory."
1247,5,"I gave him the idea that I could buy from the peasant of the village of Trofimovskoy / near Vakhru shay / you half the wasteland we ate it and put it there, away from the ground, a glazed backwater, and to get the skin to dry didn’t dry much, I dried it at the borders of our factory yard from the Zharen village, between the office and the factory, the end of the road."
1247,6,He liked this idea.
1247,7,"sent Ilya Alexeyevich Vakhrushev to find out if anyone would like to sell the empty road near the Mochovitsa river, near the gate, along the Volkov road."
1247,8,Pavel F: immediately bought two or three lanes next to 10 kop.

1248,1,"All this caused a rather large cost, but everything was for the good of the business."
1248,2,future.
1248,3,"Of course, it would be possible to make a percentage of 25-30 more economical, but I was fascinated by Ilavl F., so that everything would be beautiful, harmonious, in a straight line and clear to the eye in appearance - not hinder and see, that many people like it too."
1248,4,"But he, being carried away by this, completely wounded from the command of the Quartermaster and from Peter the Great, especially the last."
1248,5,when his Chief Quartermaster Fireplace dragged by the sleeve from the front and put in the back rows.
1248,6,"Since then, it has ceased to show definitively in Quartermaster’s, in all it has begun to rely on me.Fascinated by the buildings, Pavel F. expressed the idea that when all Rusanovtsy transfer to the road, we are on their landquietly he built the Second Tanner’s backwater, not in one year, but in 3-4 years, as well as our grandfather Timofey Anfimovich, while he was living, having four sons, he tried to build a house for every house and house so that everything worked together ."
1248,7,"And after the death of my father, I’d think about lasting so that every time there was already a ready backwater and a house, and not so that one sea would immediately work, and the other still had to be built."
1248,8,“My brother and I are also.
1248,9,"Alexander, having one son each, we are working together together while we die - will there be agreement between our sons."
1248,10,Only God knows.
1248,11,"If you agree, then you can work together at two plants, and if there is no agreement, then it can and last: everybody already has a backwater and I’m basically not to completely divide this look - to be built only for what suddenly comes through."
1248,12,15-20 years will have to last
1249,0,"and so that way, in the village, there would be identical plants."
1249,1,"If this is required and there is money, then you can build it right away in one year, or maybe one of those who need to work is Taty selfie, he willingly take money for his half of the real estate and buy a tannery backwater in Vyatka."
1249,2,"or Slobodsky even cheaper, indicating that Ignatii Dmi trіevich Laptev kunil Poskrebyshevskiy backwaters for a priceless price."
1249,3,"But Pavel f. more than once I extended my eyes to this one, but one thing was firmly convinced that grandfather Timofei Anfimovich did so in a straightforward manner, God bless him for this happiness and was lucky for all his sons."
1249,4,"Also our dad, grandfather Tim."
1249,5,"always said: ""Have fun, don’t last, but prepare everything in advance for the little factory and the house, when it is already impossible to work together, then it will be easy for you to be separate and each one will stay at his own house and at the factory.""Weighing."
1249,6,"for and against, I came to the conclusion that it’s difficult to convince Pavel F. or knock down his beloved weak string, not to let him build, but at the same time with us."
1249,7,"when there was no room for workers, and the rules of the factory inspection already required all breeders to comply with the corresponding bedrooms."
1249,8,"I agreed to build a second factory on Rusnova odvoritsy, but so far there is only one building along the small river, which will be ash and clean up later, and for now, in the second floor, I will have rooms for workers."
1249,9,Pavel F. willingly agreed to this.
1249,10,"Immediately I am building up this story was built up, which I have already described above in the previous section.For the next year, he bought rubble stone and brickIch, but did not insist on building, agreed to postpone it for another year."
1250,0,"In the year 1-908, I declared that my family had increased so much that we needed to get to our apartment, and I consider it necessary to make an extension to this house, at least the lower floor, three or four rooms."
1250,1,Pavel.
1250,2,"began to kindly ask me to shake off for another year or two, while we were building a second backwater and there, on Rusanovskaya Odvorits, we would build the same house and then we’ll throw a lot - to whom the backwater would reach the house, then take it and rebuild as it should, ""but if you’re attaching now and you’ll get a lot of reports, I don’t need any construction at all, it’ll be all wrong and uneven. """
1250,3,"I enu steel to prove; ""you have one son, and I already have six."
1250,4,"You don’t need another apartment for 15-20 years more than what you have in this house at the top, but many are already fine."
1250,5,"And after 5-6 years, time will come , sons to marry, there’s absolutely nowhere to go."
1250,6,"The second backwater to build, which we may need to be in 20 years, and this is still a question."
1250,7,"- whether it will be necessary - but because of this, now I’ll deny myself."
1250,8,"""I’ll definitely let it go to the house during the construction today."
1250,9,"And we’ll build the second backwater while we can keep it alive for another five."""
1250,10,"Pavel F. did not like it, got angry."
1250,11,The relations of this moment have become aggravated.
1250,12,"First, I will buy a brick and a stone and bring it to the courtyard house, S. Semyon."
1250,13,Fed.
1250,14,Mikheev developed a draft plan.
1250,15,"Order with Demyanka, mason Dmitriy Nikolaevich Kolotov, he drove the workers, began to dig ditches and toss up the walls, Pavel Fed."
1250,16,"Walk up to the Kolotov and say: ""Dmitriy Nikolaevich, I ask Vasya not to do this, I am against the Istroy."""
1250,17,"Ph.D. Kolotov turns to him and says: ""Pavel F., I’m a working man,"
1251,0,"I am looking for earnings, who pay a lot of money, I also listen to that."
1251,1,"I was called by Petr Al., Indicating what to do."
1251,2,I hired workers to bring them here.
1251,3,If Peter Al.
1251,4,"if he says, stop and pay all my expenses, then I will stop, and as long as he doesn’t say anything, I don’t have the right to listen to anyone."
1251,5,"I know that you are both equally rightful owners, so you’ll already agree among yourself and tell us, workers, give monotonous orders, and I’m not used to listening to conflicting orders."
1251,6,”Pavel F. went away.
1251,7,"He told me, in vain, Peter Al."
1251,8,"you get troublesome, you do it contrary."
1251,9,"God be with you, give me whatever you want, I’m leaving for Moscow today."
1251,10,"""I began to prove to him that:"" You are against my desire to build a hundred thousandth second plant, it’s completely unnecessary, a thought that your son will need after 20 years if he will have sons and if you want to live in the village."
1251,11,"But that’s still cryptic, and we’ll sweep a hundred rubles for construction, but we don’t have enough money for this backwater."
1251,12,"But I am at peace with your whim, do not hinder you - I’m tempering you; And you because of the extension to the house at 5,000 p. you consider yourself offended, you accuse me of unfairness."
1251,13,"On the contrary, it is selfishness on your part."
1251,14,and injustice.
1251,15,"When you lived in Moscow, you lived in apartments of three rooms, your family has grown, you’re planning to marry, change your name, take an apartment for 6 rooms, I haven’t said a word."
1251,16,"Also, for me, the time has come, the family has grown, because, as you can see, both the managing bank and the provincial government have grown."
1251,17,You are well aware that this lasts a lot for
1252,0,"it’s good for the common cause, but I have such a rich apartment that there is no decent dining room, there are no good people to accept."
1252,1,”Pavel Fed.
1252,2,"waved his hand, said:“ you can’t conspire."
1252,3,”He pushed his head and left.
1252,4,"The next day, he left for Moscow."
1252,5,"After his departure, we moved out of our apartment into a wooden house and ordered us to break out the bulkheads, the intentional break, to move the staircase upstairs, to move the staircase to the basement and to the new annex."
1252,6,There is a real parquet on both floors.
1252,7,"The stoves in the whole house were abandoned, the central heating was installed, and the boiler, which was supplied for central heating, arranged an open, enormous terrace, and the terrace at the upper floor was glazed."
1252,8,"on the average floor, we added 4 new rooms, and the dining room expanded in length, one of the 2 rooms was made, so there was a dining room, which accommodated 30 people freely."
1252,9,"The upper part was left without any changes, only the former open terrace was now glazed with sash frames, and the front staircase wasshy turning, now it became a straight line, and in austo of a wooden staircase, they made cement marble on rails."

1253,4,"Commodity in the bar, the bank began to accumulate in us, but some, like , private transfers, sub-contract, beetroot, split, we need to send to Moscow for sale, but not the loan was taken, it must be repaid first, otherwise the banks won’t be issued."
1253,5,"I turned to the manager of the Siberian Bank, A. M. Olennikov, for advice."
1253,6,"He said * Send together with our “lender” a bearer duplicate to the bearer of Riga and a duplicate Imagine a bank with the fact, I will calculate the loan listed on this and forward the duplicate with the invoice to the Moscow branch - a branch of the Siberian Bank."

1254,7,"“There is nothing for us to do, to live at home at the factory, let him go to Moscow, to sell, and we will send him cash on delivery, let him try, bargain.” They collected all their property, they sent them to Vyatka, rented the apartment, but they still left the pantry for Kokorevk, for the office they took the room in Kokorevk in the front building, at the very top, overlooking the Kremlin."

1259,0,"that one of the Voshkin’s brothers died, the widow took away a large amount of her former personal capital - Monakin’s creditworthiness greatly decreased."
1259,1,"They don’t sell to you in credit, but it’s better to sell it for a ruble in pood cheaper, but in good hands, and so on."
1259,2,"I was indignant: the man was informed that he had been given, handed over, and the bills had been taken into account, and he had to telegraph his advice."

1259,12,"Over the course of six months, all the bills by the Doshkin Brothers were paid in full."
1259,13,"But in the spring of the following year, Pavel F. ѣzdil in Toskva and Nresd."

1259,15,"It seems to me that now it’s more dangerous."""
1259,16,"Pavel F. said: “If they bought the old bills of exchange of the Moshkins, I found it inconvenient to permanently refuse them credit, therefore I decided to sell them a little more.” But the affairs of the Koshkins had already quietly gone, they all started to beware of selling them, and at the next Nizhny Novgorod fair I declined to sell them."

1260,7,"But the Moshkins, indeed, at the end of the same Nizhny Novgorod fair, could not stand it - they went bankrupt and began to bother to establish an administration."
1260,8,"Immediately after the fair, BE Moscow lenders gathered, including many who received an invitation, ti!"
1260,9,"It’s like a bill for 4800 rubles, for a sale that was dear to Vam in the spring, then the Koshkins didn’t pay us, and the bill was a protest."
1260,10,"Pavel F. Pohal again in Doskva for the collection of creditors, with a view to whether it is possible to collect p. Koshkins, give a discount and secretly transfer their bills to them, but the Koshkins rejected that ""the bill has already entered the lists on behalf of your company, now nothing can be done."""

1260,18,Pavel F. then told me many times that they did not know for which to give their vote: p. Friendship with the Quartermaster and K.I.
1260,19,"Nazarov, trusted by the Alabuzovs, always did a lot of good to us, and Senilov was again our Vyatka friend., And sometimes we also deigned to the banks."

1261,2,But finally it turned out that both.
1261,3,they were elected as administrators and two young.
1261,4,"Moshkin, and the fifth - some Moscow lawyer, a representative of banks."
1261,5,This administration lasted five years.
1261,6,"Before graduation, the selected administrators began to gradually buy up the skillful creditors and bills in parts."
1261,7,Anton Iva Alafuzov also offered us 40 kopecks each.
1261,8,for the ruble.
1261,9,"We immediately agreed, and I owe half a mile to calculate the amount from An."
1261,10,"Alabuzov, give him the full amount of the bill, with the inscription on the back  in his personal name, without the turn on usѣ, i.e."

1261,13,"Neither the Zhegorodsky Fair and St. Petersburg, according to the Commandant’s delivery, Pavel F. has already completely refused to go."
1261,14,"I completely took these things upon myself.Pavel F., who lived in a residence from Moscow to his own village, lived upstairs in our common home, and in the spring he started building his own separate house."
1261,15,"But he wanted, first of all, to build a second backwater and to split the factories."
1261,16,"If he got a factory on Rusanovskaya Zemlya, then he would like to build a house for himself there on Rusanovskaya Zemlya, and if he got our existing factory with a shoe factory, then he intended to build a house on the same factory yard on the highway, next to eat a swarm."
1261,17,"But since I didn’t agree to build the second one for the time being, Pavel F. Rushil built his own house on the same door, where our common first house stood .."
1261,18,"But the whole courtyard was on the 22 sled, the house was occupied by gates from the street ІІ soot."

1262,2,Pavel F. decided to squeeze into this gap.
1262,3,"He built a two-story house on the II floor in full width, and since there was no place to enter the courtyard for the gate, he built the gate for the house and built the whole width of the stone at the construction site for a stable, barn, carriage , a coachman and a cellar."
1262,4,"He ordered oak parquet for the floor in Noskv, brought 10 gels, roads, and the craftsmen for the flooring arrived - the same parquet chick."
1262,5,from Moscow.
1262,6,It was very unpleasant for us that he had shut himself and us and half of our garden repelled him.
1262,7,"It was also a pity that Apollinariy Alexeyevna was very sorry: a huge Christmas tree grew against our porch, just like on that place, where Pavel F. built a stone horse to his house."
1262,8,But there's nothing to be done - there was no other suitable free plot of land.
1262,9,"Or he needs to be built at one or another plant, or here."
1262,10,"I assumed that I should not mind him - let him build a home, to spend one hundred thousand rubles on goodness to build a plant."
1262,11,"From wear from the moment of construction, I with Pavel F. became even more aggravated."
1262,12,"When he finished building a house and went with his family to live in his house, neither I nor my family - Nobody went to him, and they did not go to us."
1262,13,"We met only in the streets or in the factory, there we talked alone, and the family met only in the church."
1262,14,"Pavel F. and his whole family didn’t have any of the Vakhrushevs and the others living in the village, and also generally no one living in the village, and they themselves did not invite anyone to visit."

1263,7,"From Irkutsk, we had to go to Khabarovsk for 10 or 12 days with soil transportation."
1263,8,"” Until now, I have not been far from Irkutsk, it was of great interest to me to see Lake Baikal for the first time - this is such a huge, like the sea, one cannot see the other shore."
1263,9,"The Circum-Baikal Railroad is also very interesting - several dozen long tunnels, and some of them should go along the railroad along the very shore of Lake Baikal."
1263,10,"You look through the window to the left - all is one water, and it is so impressive that the trains go along the sea, and you look at the right, through the opposite window there is a solid stone wall, a hewn mountain, then you enter the Vi tunnel, and so on."

1343,13,"I’ve known since 1908, i.e."
1343,14,at that timewhen I ate Sukhovnms and Starodumov they requested the railway from Kazan to Vyatka via Yaransk.
1343,15,"“Then Starodumov is familiar with me as an engineer” lsnikoynm in case you have to send from the cany of the railway to the towns of Slobodskoy, then the engineer can do such a thing: lapse and help to petitionby ministries or where needed."
1343,16,"Since then engineerF, S. lsnikov, maintained acquaintance with me: annually on holidays, on Easter and on New Year's Eve sent me a lot by post card withthen, and when I went to Petersburg, he recognized himself in some way * and almost every section came to see mehis respect and, as he expressed himself, to remind about “myself” and to cope; Is there any news in the field of construction - railways .. and to him, on the send 'togreetings; always turned away, but on a personal• attending St. Petersburg I apologized that I could not relate each visit, for I was visiting Petersburg, always for a short time and having a lot of my “business”, I couldn’t take the time to visit him yet; but I was always glad to see him at home ; Lsnikov said that he did not pretend to visit and was never considered to be, but to go to many places as if “along the way”: often a former district, near St. Isaac’s Cathedral and knowing that I was staying; coming to St. Petersburg; on the street: Gogol, here and he neglects: to cope, to see and to remind myself; hoping and a ""dѣlo"
1344,0,"send for mutual use One of those visits to many, and I learned from a student at the Tuteisk Institute, V. A. Livanova."
1344,1,"I then introduced them and asked the engineer lsnikov when he would have work on the wear and tear during the summer, so took V.A."
1344,2,"Livanov’s assistants, for practical work, as students at the Shutei Institute, are sure to try to find practical work during construction or during construction, which is useful for them to practically learn their science, and, by the way, to earn a little during the summer vacancy."
1344,3,Engineer F.S.
1344,4,Dsnikovz gave his word that at the first opportunity he would have in mind V.A.
1344,5,Livanov.
1344,6,"I gave him my address and asked to come to him periodically and expressed that I should stick to him, the rules: “Nika-kim acquaintance” should not be neglected: every even casual acquaintance, keep and occasionally remind yourself of or attendance, or invitation."

1344,14,"Does it make any sense to go to him at the suggestion of our little wish, the road from the city of Vyatka to the town of Slobodskgo."
1344,15,Many engineer msnikov briefly explained that this is a new acc.

1344,17,for long sro

1345,1,"Of course, it wasn’t interesting for them to arrange one or another branch to Russia, but Me’s engineer, who’s established the railway network, has to neglect the construction of such roads for at least 50 the first time, and then they will be hundreds of years old."
1345,2,"First of all, it will be sorted out which are more beneficial for society, either the meaning of profitability or the meaning of the proposed conditions, they will also blame first of all, to build Persons interested All activities in your city should be made at your own expense from search and upon petitions - to submit a short financial plan and turnover, which is meant for transportation on this basis."
1345,3,"The Maxim Society, having familiarized itself with the submitted petitions, and the material at the petitions, they themselves determine what they are for Having agreed to the applicants, they began to build this building one at a time, from the first lines, and immediately command their own people, check their expenses and carefully put together their financial plan, and sometimes, seeing that from time to time it was made by experienced enerom then provrki not immediately dѣlayut and vѣryat this engineer who proizvodil izyskanіv."
1345,4,"In any case, you should take advantage immediately to get acquainted with the management of this island for now, and when you find yourself interested in implementing your idea of ​​building a railway."
1345,5,"to the town of Slobodskaya, then I offer you my services, take the initial plan and draw up a financial plan, conduct all necessary efforts in Deterburg, for this reason."
1345,6,"I rejected that, with gratitude, I accept his offer and are ready."
1345,7,"tomorrow, I’m going to meet to meet with the rectors of the board of directors, the island of access roads, but for now, without any obligation, I’m on the right side, because I can’t cut it alone or even begin to petition for it without my right."
1345,8,"Vyatka, and, in the city, Slobodsky discuss this issue with public"
1346,0,"breeders or from the towns of Slobodsky and Vyatka to enter with the applicant, and also agree •with you about the remuneration for the work proposed by you on the initial deterioration and so on."
1346,1,Engineer F.E.Lsni kov completely agreed with me.
1346,2,"The next day, on the phone, talking to the board of directors of the island of railway, access roads, he followed me and we both went to the office of the board of directors."
1346,3,"We were personally received by “Sam Inzhe - Nere Maksimov, very kindly and simply talked to us; it seemed to me that you did the right thing and that you first went to talk to me without any material and have not yet made any expenses and expenses for them."
1346,4,Other .
1346,5,"Your branch of 30 or 40 versts on the island could have little interest ': for us, first of all, the most interesting branches are in the X50-300 verst and to the west or south of Russia."
1346,6,"Our island is taking in more interesting money in terms of profitability or strategic attitude and solicits - there is a government submission of a concession for 50 or 100 years, the exploitation of this bank in the future, and the name of the concession is easy to place ”shares Abroad."
1346,7,"Yours is ""the same small branch of oil is interesting for foreign financiers, but as it is supposed to connect a district town with many factories, with a large highway coming from Siberia via Vyatka to Petersburg, I suppose, I’ll be able to to obtain permission from the government and concession for this building.If you make the initial work and clear - the necessary work is F., E. Lsnikov, then we will not check, having agreed with you, we will immediately enter with a request for concession and “God will give , for the next let's start building and if we don’t meet the unforeseen for the holding, we’ll build everything in one year."
1346,8,"Thanking engineer Maximov, I promised that through engineer losnikov I would sanctify him in the position of our Slobodskaya-Vyatka branch, but if nothing of this"

1347,1,.
1347,2,"""Engineer Maksimov made a very good impression on me: a serious, amiable business man."
1347,3,"I invited F.E.Lsnikov to eat at a restaurant and began to consult him, likewhat needs to be done now much further."
1347,4,"Thoroughly discuss this in ""ask, I will instruct him to draw up Lisnikov in writing in the name of the VKT groupA brief and memorial note was sent to the local and Slobodsky breeders and public institutions to offer to send Slobodsky to Vyatka from time to time and prepare all the necessary materials, and initiate a solicitation before the Society for railway access roads and hand this note to many."
1347,5,"At the same time, I asked Msnikov to appoint the approximate amount of the cost of the initial work, so that if wewe’ll finish the construction, but the construction for some reason will not be demolished or “will not be carried out at all, so that much more, exceptHe wouldn’t have owed him a full amount for any difficulty and would not have borne any expenses."
1347,6,"F. E. Lsnikov stated that he would hire, at his own expense, students to work with at his own expense, approximately, a month at his own expense."
1347,7,"sometimes it is necessary to weave the peasants a small sum, for chopping, cutting through or for trampled grass or bread, but this is small sumy, from 100 to 300 rubles."
1347,8,"Drawing up a financial plan and so on, everything will be sent by me to the account of the same fee for 1200 rubles."
1347,9,I found that it was not very expensive and we could do it.
1347,10,"He told him that it would be more convenient to speak with the factory workers and with the Sloboda public institutions, if you accept the expenses for cutting the forest and read the alleged peasants."
1347,11,"It’s better you assign 1,500 rubles for everything and that our breeders"
1348,0,they saw that no unforeseen account was presented to them.
1348,1,F. E. Dsnikov quickly agreed to this.
1348,2,Day through?
1348,3,"he brought me a short note in detail, which I could take to Vyatka for discussion with Sloboda citizens and district breeders, but since it’s not possible to send an early child, I should not talk to Sloboda public institutions eat factory."
1348,4,"I started talking one at a time by chicks, first of all I told Yasa the companion of the whole company, Pavel Fedorovich, who often recalled MANY OVER that I had traveled in 1908 on applications for railways why you did not start applying for the construction of the railway."
1348,5,It was difficult to explain to him that for such a petition it was necessary to have all the evidence and so on to begin such a petition.
1348,6,"But, this hour, coming from St. Petersburg, as suggested by engineer Dаsnikov, I just said briefly to Payal Fedorovich that, finally, I had a first acquaintance."
1348,7,"by me in 1908 goal, eat Pua Teish engineer, Lsnikov, it came in handy: he introduced me to the founder of the island for the construction of railway access roads, and the last one didn’t want to see the search for the railway link from Vyatka to Slobodskaya, but we must first do it at our own expense."
1348,8,"If we accept the benefits, then if the government disburses, this company will build a subsidiary at its own expense and will benefit from the income from this subsidiary for 50 years, after the government disburses."
1348,9,"It is still necessary to spend 1,500 rubles on the exploration, but if it turns out that the island is railway."
1348,10,"access roads if this branch is unprofitable, refuses to build, then 1,500 rubles spent by the breeders."
1348,11,disappear forever.
1348,12,"Paved Fedorovich, Yanadu Shav, said 1,500 rubles."
1348,13,"the money is small, it’s obligatory to make the survey sooner, and then we will collect 100,000 rubles from the breeders, and as a last resort, we alone will pay 1,500 rubles."
1348,14,Give food telegram.
1349,0,"mu, so that they could press and make finals for the finals."
1349,1,"I insisted that there was no reason to give telegrams: you couldn’t do this before, in winter, engineers didn’t go to work in winter, but the petition had to be openednot single-handedly, but from a group of breeders and together with the City."
1349,2,Slobodskoy exercise.
1349,3,"I will first have a separate conversation with each other.privately, as well as with Slobodsky City Head, and then we will arrange a general meeting and together we proceed to the house."
1349,4,"Most interested in building it from Vyatka to the Sloboda railway were the match manufacturers of Vyatsky uzdz, Andrei and Mikhail Imanovichi Sapozhnikoyan: they had a match factory that was completely separate from Sapozhnikovskaya, although they had to have a lot of them."
1349,5,They dreamed if they had to drive the railway.
1349,6,"if Slobodskogo in Vyatka, then its direction must be sent to the tan sky railroad bridge, because a separate bridge across the Vyatka river for Sloboda Vyatka would not have been calculated: for a bridge through the Vyatka river would cost more than 1,000,000 rubles, but it would cost more already through the Vyatka river from Slobodsky take the direct direction from Slobodsky to the 30th Garsky bridge, while the railroad will go near the Sapozhnikovs factory, which is of great interest to them, because it took them very much to transport the Vyatka aspen forest for matches it’s expensive and through matches it’s; the cost turned out to be more expensive than 2 competitors, especially those with factories built on the banks of the river."
1349,7,"Sapozhniko washed it was necessary either to transfer the factory to the banks of the river, or to report that the railway on Slobodskaya was passing by their village."
1349,8,All of this was well known.
1349,9,"In Slobodsky Jew, uncle of matchmakers Sapozhnikov, Petr Isaakovich Sapozhnikoy; had trade and a bakery factory, on Rozhdestvenskaya Street, opposite the Regional Zemsky Council."
1349,10,"” / or from a corner to a corner, / not far from the Sloboda poorhouse and from the kazar."
1349,11,h began a conversation with the breeders separately for each.
1350,0," 261 zadis for the desirability of building I / d. from the Zagarskogo bridge to the Slobodskaya bridge, through the village of the Salotnikovs, except Nikolai Ilyich Vakhrushev, who said that we are transferring our business to Borovitsa, to the banks of the Vyatka river, and therefore we don’t need a railway to Slobodskaya, and if it’s near Boro Vitya went to the railway line and suggested that Borovitsa make a station, so I would ask not to do it, since there are more larcenies near the roads and there are more shelters for tramps, unemployed, deserted people, and therefore we have no part neither built, nor built out We won’t accept searches and we won’t accept any requests and we won’t invite any collections on this issue."
1350,1,"The bokonn, the sheep-sheepskin breeders learned that the line was being designed from Slobodsky to the Zagarsky bridge, by the Sapozhnikov’s, they said so the road is not of interest to us: near our factory it will not go close and the station closest to us will be in the village of Vakhrushev, so we would have to carry the goods for 8 versts, to the station Vakhrushevo, so we would prefer to take the goods directly to the Vyatka for 12 versts, and by to that they refused to participate in expenses even for exploration."
1350,2,The rest of the breeders of Vakhrushevna started bankruptcy.
1350,3,"In early 1912, Ivan Fedorovich Vakhrushev first went bankrupt, followed by Stepan Fed."
1350,4,"Vakhrushev, then Afa Nasi and Alexander Ilyich Vakhrushevna, Timofey Parfenovich Vakhrushev and Nicholas and Peter Vasilyevich Vakhrushevna, finally, Mikhail and Nikolai Ivanovich chi Vakhrushevna."

1354,5,"If subsequently it turns out that it’s tedious to spend another 10,000 rubles on us."
1354,6,"or 20,000, then I believe that together the breeders collect this amount, but if hundreds of thousands of rubles are required, then, I believe, we will abandon all buildings."

1474,9,They are more than last year.
1474,10,"Nt which members of the merchants said 750,000, another 800,000, and one told us to guess, we agree to eat as much as they themselves showed."
1475,0,"The Tax Inspector reads a statement in which 1.700.000 rubles were written and they all looked at me in amazement, they said it yourself, then there was no need to argue."
1475,1,"The different inspector said that this figure was not exaggerated or reduced, I have it There is information from the quarterly agreement that, under the contracts, it was handed over to the treasury for approximately one and a half million, and for private trade it is necessary to add from 10 to 15%, so that you can correctly take the turnover of 1.700.000 rubles."
1475,2,The presence unanimously agreed and decided to determine the turnover of one million seven hundred thousand rubles.
1475,3,"I stated that the company never objected to the amount of the turnover received by our company and we will not mind it now, even more so that it itself stated this amount, but I personally never agreed with the majority of members of the Privat State that for suppliers to the treasury under the contracts, it is not possible to accept the same percentage of profitability as is applied to private breeders or private traders кот who are involved in treasury contracts and about Their oroty is not proved; you are determined approximately, in most cases, by smaller ones."
1475,4,"Here you have a good example, last year for tanneries, set a percentage yield of 10%."
1475,5,"With the declared and determined ІPresistent turnover of our company, 700,000 rubles."
1475,6,", we should have been taxed with a yield of 70,000 rubles."

1475,8,"Now the folding presence has established a yield of 15% for the skin factories, I objected, nor remained in the minorityѣ."
1475,9,"If the Presence determined the turnover of our company now, as they said here 750 or 800,000 rubles, then our"
1476,0,fiir would have to pay tax.
1476,1,"from 120,000 rubles ... in fact, this is right, since we didn’t have any profit, but when the turnover was determined to be І.700.000 rubles."
1476,2,", if it is established, but the profitability is 15%, our firin will have a profit of 255,000 rubles calculated for fishing, then this is complete injustice and I declare that we will appeal to the Provincial Folding Presence, if I submit our books to him."
1476,3,"we filed an application at the Regional Presence, it was stated that, due to an illness of the accountant by the time of the application, the books were not finished and they could not be submitted to the local Primary, but the real Domains accountant and 8% of their vacation returned My books and books are running out."
